vkVSCC7xljjrAI4UGfnKEQ,5,"Super simple place but amazing nonetheless. It's been around since the 30's and they still serve the same thing they started with: a bologna and salami sandwich with mustard. 

Staff was very helpful and friendly.",1,0,1,0
n6QzIUObkYshz4dz2QRJTw,5,"Small unassuming place that changes their menu every so often. Cool decor and vibe inside their 30 seat restaurant. Call for a reservation. 

We had their beef tartar and pork belly to start and a salmon dish and lamb meal for mains. Everything was incredible! I could go on at length about how all the listed ingredients really make their dishes amazing but honestly you just need to go. 

A bit outside of downtown montreal but take the metro out and it's less than a 10 minute walk from the station.",1,1,0,0
MV3CcKScW05u5LVfF6ok0g,5,"Lester's is located in a beautiful neighborhood and has been there since 1951. They are known for smoked meat which most deli's have but their brisket sandwich is what I come to montreal for. They've got about 12 seats outside to go along with the inside. 

The smoked meat is up there in quality and taste with Schwartz's and you'll find less tourists at Lester's as well.",1,1,0,0
IXvOzsEMYtiJI0CARmj77Q,4,"Love coming here. Yes the place always needs the floor swept but when you give out  peanuts in the shell how won't it always be a bit dirty. 

The food speaks for itself, so good. Burgers are made to order and the meat is put on the grill when you order your sandwich. Getting the small burger just means 1 patty, the regular is a 2 patty burger which is twice the deliciousness. 

Getting the Cajun fries adds a bit of spice to them and whatever size you order they always throw more fries (a lot more fries) into the bag.",1,0,0,0

ymAUG8DZfQcFTBSOiaNN4w,4,"Who would have guess that you would be able to get fairly decent Vietnamese restaurant in East York? 

Not quite the same as Chinatown in terms of pricing (slightly higher) but definitely one of the better Vietnamese restaurants outside of the neighbourhood. When I don't have time to go to Chinatown, this is the next best thing as it is down the street from me.

So far the only items I have tried are the phos (beef, chicken & vegetarian) - and they have not disappointed me! Especially the chicken pho.

Next time I go back, I'm going to try the banh cuon (steamed rice noodle) and the vermicelli!",1,0,0,-1

PIsUSmvaUWB00qv5KTF1xA,4,"This is currently my parents new favourite restaurant. 

We come here in the morning for dim sum. They are not the cart pushing type of dim sum, it is order off of the sheet. Dim sum is not bad and not expensive either.

We also frequent the dinner scene. Their set dinner menu is not bad. We typically order a 6 dish menu and it's big enough to feed a family of 9 with leftovers. 

Overall, food is pretty tasty!",1,0,0,1

My two favourite dishes are the rice flour rolls and the chicken pho. The rice flour rolls are always fresh whenever I'm there! And the chicken pho is always flavourful!! mmmm....just thinking of it makes me want some!

FunI9om-aK5oMIIJmhMlZA,4,"a must stop when you are in montreal!

I was in Mtl for the weekend and wind up eating here 2 nights in a row!

The sandwiches here are unbelieveable! The smoked meat is so tasty and salty but so good. The bread definitely complements the meat!

Not much of a line up if you come either later in the evening.

reeZj98t_X1DrZgQgFs9Kg,4,"Hidden on the east end of the Danforth is a lovely Thai restaurant. Found this restaurant while surfing on Yelp.

Surprisingly this place is pretty big to seat a big group of 12 and still have a few more small tables available. They are mainly a take-out restaurant, as many of the customers came in for take-out, and the service was a little bit slow. However, the food was great and it accommodating for many different people - seafood lovers, vegans, etc.

Definitely recommend the basil fried rice and the fried sole fish with eggplant but for those curry lovers out there, stay away from the roti curry chicken - no curry taste, just coconut favour. But the Roti itself was really good.

Most of the dishes were under $10 - definitely a good deal!

Will be back to try the noodle dishes!",1,1,-1,1
rQgIiq1FJR8NwBJuWlUn7Q,4,"Decided to try this place after reading the reviews. Was not disappointed. Huge portions and a bit of a long wait. They will take phone orders over the walk ins. So call ahead to order!

The decor is definitely interesting. Although, the outside has lots of lights as decoration, the inside is kind of dark. The red lighting and orange menu makes it hard to read.

The food is not bad. Although they tell you that the vegetarian platter is only for one person - this platter is definitely made for sharing!",1,-1,0,0

Cute shop love the concept!

Lots of varieties of cookie but pretty pricy! There are probably about 10 varieties cookies and about seven milk flavours. The banana flavoured milk reminds us of the banana cough syrup we used to drink as a kid!

They do have homemade cookie ice cream sandwiches but the cookie is on the thinner side.",1,1,0,1

DcON7DHHHsvl8fByRl41MQ,4,"Very busy place here on a Friday night. Definitely has a queen street feel with the decor. 

Food is a little pricey but not bad. Shrimp tempura appetizer is a good size for sharing. Sweet potato wedges are well paired with the wasabi mayo. 

Rolls are very good. They have a different pink dragon roll that has scallops on the top. Green dragon rolls are definitely a must try. The avocado is very thinly sliced sprinkled with something yummy on top.",1,1,0,-1

After trying a few things on the menu - the true favourite is still the dan dan noodles. There is something about the spicy peanut sauce soup base that makes it so flavourful. Plus when you add their homemade chili oil - it makes it so good.

Because of Sun's dan dan noodles - my bf and I will always order the dan fan noodle whenever we see it on the menu but so far, no one has the same flavour as Sun's. Sun's    is the best we have had!!!",1,0,1,0
WYDFJOBOl7cycd7gN-c_xA,1,"really excited to hear of this restaurant coming to Toronto. When it finally opened, my friend and I were really excited to try this place.

Service here is not great, it felt like they had forgotten about us and that they didn't care about the service as everything came out one at a time. My friend and I had each ordered a ginger beer, which came out at two separate times (it was almost as if they had to go in the back and make it themselves - that's how long it took).

There is absolutely no vegetarian options, except for the one cold noodle - the mushroom bun is not vegetarian.

The pork belly bun was nothing special - just a piece of meat with the bun. For my vegetarian friend, we had ordered the bun plain so she could experience it as well, and they literally just gave it to us plain, with no sauce, no kimchi.

The Momofuko ramen was awful. It was bland and mushy. After a few bites, I couldn't handle eating anymore.

Momofuko is not the place to go if you want real ramen. I've had better experience with instant noodles.",-1,0,-1,0

We had ordered the eggspectation omelette and eggs benedict. The omelette was bland, overcooked. The eggs benedict were ok, but I've had better. The portion size has come down.

z9e32TaBomM5uY7fHYqYKg,1,"If you have not yet tried Wasabi - don't bother.

It's expensive and the food is disgusting. You have to order the sushi at the table, but everything else (i.e. salads, soups, cooked food) you can get up and go get it yourself.

The food is very bland, the sushi does not taste like anything - not even sure if the fish is fresh.

On the weekends, everyone seems to be there for the snow crab legs - if that's what you are coming for, forget it! You have to fight\/wait in-line to get it. It's probably easier to eat it at Mandarin.

If anyone suggests to go there, I highly recommend you go somewhere else!",-1,-1,0,-1
Tv-_7d1sa-6cPTZ20exTLA,2,"Atmosphere for this restaurant is nice but service, not so much. 

Came here for a friend's birthday. Although, we made reservations and checked in a few minutes early, we still had to wait a good 45 minutes before sitting down at our table. When we made the reservations, we were informed we would have to leave a certain time - which we didn't think they would enforce, considering we did not get our table in time. However, they did, and we were not impressed.

The space in the restaurant is also very tight, my boyfriend got hit in the head a few times while sitting at the table.

I had ordered a seafood pasta dish, which was kind of bland (not much flavour). My boyfriend had ordered one of the specials of the night - filet mignon, which also was not up to par.

Overall, I've had better pasta. I'm not sure if it was just the two dishes I had that wasn't up to par, as my other friends did enjoy theirs.",-1,1,-1,0
Ebggx4Zlc4VWReJMG1nT6w,1,"Terrible service and not so great drinks.

We happen to be in the plaza and saw this place for bubble tea, so we decided to grab a few to go.

First of all, the two menus is located in a very awkward place (one very high up on the wall and one in the corner also by the wall), set up is not really friendly neither can it accommodate a large group of people to look at the menu at the same time.

The menu items itself had different options than your typically bubble tea place. Their specialty are mousse drinks - which we had no idea what exactly it was. So when we asked the staff, they said it was some sort of cheese. 

For a Sunday afternoon, they were also out of grass jelly and pudding, which are ingredients in quite a few of their drinks (so not sure how that works).

The service is really bad, they don't understand English so when you asked them about the menu items, they can't really explain what they are.

We had ordered the following:
- slush mango (came with tapioca and mousse)
- peach ice tea
- roasted oolong milk tea
- supernova kumquat lemonade

And when we asked what the difference between a supernova kumquat lemonade under the galaxy drinks section (which are supposed to be layered drinks), and the kumquat lemonade, they said it had a layer of blue mousse - so we were like ok we will try it then. But what came was just a bigger cup size of the kumquat lemonade. When we asked them again, they said it was just a size difference, that's what makes it supernova - which is pretty dumb to me as on the menu both items had the same two size choices of regular or large. 

The mango slush and the roasted oolong milk tea wasn't bad. But the other two was not that great. The tea had a big floral taste that overpowered everything. There was no peach taste in the peach ice tea. The kumquat one had no kumquat taste and was just bitter from the lime and it tasted like it had no sugar in it at all.

I guess if you need a non-busy place to use WIFI and work, then this is the place, no one wants to come here.

Also - their gimmick also seems to be the lightbulb drinks, which were intriguing to us, but you are not allowed to take the lightbulb home...

We will definitely not be returning...",-1,0,-1,0

Ny3gmyxodfnp4JK0Geaovg,2,"Opened by Pickle Barrel, Glow is meant to be this new healthy eating restaurant that ensures you do not over indulge on certain foods. They have burgers that are served bunless and a side of salad - so make sure you read the fine print prior to order to ensure you get what you want.

The food is ok, not memorable. The atmosphere and decor is beautiful. And the service was not bad - after hearing all the horror stories I thought we would be getting terrible service.

They also have these 100 calories shooter glass desserts that are cute, but also not memorable in taste.

I think this place is probably good for a drink (for the atmosphere and decor), but not so much for their food.",0,1,1,0
ckUKRR2BV7wg9ehIRiZ6aw,1,"after reading the reviews on yelp, my boyfriend and i decided to give this place a try, especially since we are on a mission to try ramen in every city we visit.

we were really excited, as when we were in NYC, we had really good ramen. 

listening to the reviews we started off with the gyoza appetizer - which was not as good as everyone says it is. It was pan fried with the thin layer of skin, but there was an aftertaste of soap water. Which I should have known, since the glass of water they served us was disgusting!

We had ordered the jumbo sumo ramen - beware, it is a very big bowl of noodles, which we did not expect.

The sumo ramen came with a half boil egg, seaweed, pork belly, and other veggies. The noodles and pork belly was good. Soup was tasteless.

Definitely would not go back again.",-1,0,0,0
8KwvvDYbvwDM5WxAOhHBRA,1,"Came here for a friend's birthday. She had looked it up and thought it sound good. First of all, when we made reservations, they only had a 7pm time slot for us (we were looking for 8pm) and when we were there, we were seated in the lower area of the restaurant, which was pretty empty.

There was an extensive menu, everything on the menu sound good, but when we got our food - there was nothing special, especially for what we paid for it. 

The pizza's are huge portions - so if you order it, make sure you share it.

There are 3 risottos on the menu, the seasonal vegetable one is the better one. Some of the pastas were portioned differently, some were huge, others were tiny - so be careful!

The food came out really fast after we ordered, so fast, that some of the food was cold (not sure if they make it in advance and just heat up afterwards). The desserts took forever to come.

At the end of the night when the bill came, there was a water service charge ($12.50) for 9 people for just getting tap water. And 18% gratuity after taxes.

Atmosphere was good, but other than that I do not recommend this place at all.",0,1,-1,-1

uRHeiP5iEnvnkN8P3gY-8A,1,"I give up on this place! I have gotten burritos and other things from this place on several occasions and it's always been sub-par. Bland food, overcooked, sometimes burnt (nachos). As a result, I haven't bothered going or ordering from there in well over a year. Well, today I had a craving for Mexican and since Toronto has a huge lack of Mexican restaurant choices and because I'm busy working at home, my husband and myself decided to order from BarBurrito's delivery. I should also mention that if you go to justeat.ca BarBurrito charges $7 delivery. Orderit.ca has no charge. Don't know if that's the ordering website or the restaurant, but it's a tip for anyone who decides to order from this place.

So I went ahead and placed the order...only to have it be ""rejected"" by BarBurrito, because they are busy right now. This restaurant is listed on two different food ordering sites, but they won't deliver if they don't feel inclined?? SERIOUSLY! 

So I have learned my lesson. Don't give places second, or even third chances. And this place...don't even give it a first chance. Not worth it at ALL.",-1,0,-1,-1
BPDhmOxSC4jk-hi9Va47cw,2,"I think I may have been let down by this place because of all the rave reviews. But the fact is, I've eaten here twice and neither time was spectacular. 

My expectations of a breakfast place are cheap prices, good food (because eggs are hard to mess up), fast turnover and service. This place has prices on the high end of breakfast place, on weekends they are very crowded and it will take some time to be seated and the food is alright. 

The last time I went, I was with my husband and we went in the door to a huge crowd. There was no wait to be seated sign, but we guessed correctly and waited. Problem is that you pay and wait in the same place, which meant people were coming and going in a very small area. It was chaos for awhile. Finally we were seated outside at a picnic table and told that other people may be seated with us at the table, because they lacked space. 

The waitress took some time to arrive and by then we were ready to give our order. I ordered eggs and bacon and toast. We also each ordered fruit smoothies. I asked for mine without banana. The waitress came back a few minutes later and said with a straight face, ""The guys back there put like three bananas in your smoothie!"" 

It took me a minute to realize she was joking....heh....

We played several rounds of Scrabble on an iphone because the food was taking quite awhile and it finally came out. Our drinks were no where to be seen. We had to ask twice for them. By then we were almost done the food!

The food was alright, but I usually go to places like Egg Smart and for the cost, they give you way more food, for a better price and honestly, I think it tastes way better. These famous ""Boom frites"" are just thick, cut potatoes and they give you one slice of toast! 

Anyway, if you're in the area and really want some breakfast, it's not terrible, but I think you can do way better! 

Oh, and I disagree that it's a good place for a group. Unless you want to wait forever...or make a group by joining another couple at their picnic table!",0,-1,-1,0

The meat is bland and often dry and overcooked, served with rice and a salad (generic lettuce with ranch dressing-type stuff) and their naan tastes like cardboard. The rest of the stuff is edible, but the naan is just plain atrocious. I have had Afghani food in other locations and it's flavourful and delicious. This does not hold up. I guess it's take out quality, so a sort of McDonald's version of Afghan food, but I'd take a Big Mac any day over this stuff. Bleh.",-1,0,0,0
f17tpJXCwTE0M137d9yX6g,2,"While I really enjoyed the noodles, their signature pork buns, which seemed to be something everyone orders and raves about, I did not like at all. The pork was pure fat and while it wasn't gristly, it was SO greasy, the grease positively dripped all over your hands. It was hugely unappetizing. I couldn't taste the cucumbers and didn't see any evidence of scallions. It was basically just pure fat, wrapped in a bland ""bun"". So I guess if you enjoy really fatty, greasy appetizers, this is the right deal. (Really, I can't stress enough how fatty the pork was...it was purely, white, greasy fat! Either change the name of the dish to pork fat buns, or please add some actual pork!)

The noodles however, were quite good and I liked the flavour combinations. I had the dan dan noodles, which is spicy pork, dried scallops and peanuts. I enjoyed that you could really taste the peanuts. I was a little disappointed that the pork was ground pork, instead of shredded pork. It made the dish seem cheaper and less inspired. 

I liked the atmosphere, but the seating is at long tables and so you share the space with whoever they place next to you. The seats are long benches, so if you're in the middle of the bench, you have to lift your leg over...I saw guys struggling to do this...now imagine being a girl, wearing a skirt and having to do this.

Iw-bsaG215bJVdmlI4UfRg,2,"A couple of weeks ago I was watching Diner's, Drive-Ins and Dives...BIG MISTAKE! This show is a heart attack in the making.

It also gives you cravings...often for food you can't possibly get, because they're making some crazy thing across the country that you cannot possibly find a duplicate for. 

Naturally I got a crazy craving for fish and chips...my mistake being that this was a Sunday and for whatever reason, no fish and chip places are open on Sunday. 

I did a lot of looking around, before I found this place, which wasn't too far away and was, most importantly, open! 

This is a quirky place, with wood panelling on the walls and some random fish hung around the place.

Fry's boasts full day breakfasts and the fish and chips. I saw plenty of people coming for the full day breakfasts, which are decently priced and looked pretty good, if nothing special.

We came for the F&Cs though! 

We ordered the single piece, which was MORE than enough food. Quite expensive though. You're looking at around $15\/meal of one large piece of fish and some fries.

It was good, but it wasn't great. Worst of all, the tartar sauce came in sealed packages....ugh.

I'm sorry, but when I'm paying a premium for my fish and chips, at a place named after it's Fish and Chips...I WANT SOME DAMN PROPER TARTAR SAUCE! It's only like the EASIEST thing in the world to make.

Service was fine. No complaints. The waitress did her job...took our order, gave us our food and gave us the bill....that was her job and she did no more and no less.

The restaurant ambiance wasn't there, the food wasn't special and the prices weren't good.

Next time I get a fish and chips craving I'm going to try elsewhere.",-1,0,0,-1
