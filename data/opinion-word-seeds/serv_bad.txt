She got in her face and was extremely rude to the poor girl right in front of the customers.
The older woman who seemed to be the owner or manager would not stop yelling at her after this mistake.
This is unprofessional and simply inappropriate.
When the sandwiches did come out the woman who appeared to be the cook set them down and was about to take away my hardly eaten soup without saying a word.
I was of course waiting for my sandwich to eat with the soup so I asked her to please leave the soup
She put it down and rudely threw her hand up as if to say "well excuuuuse me" haha
With that inappropriate atmosphere and those ridiculous prices they'll goout of business just like the people who occupied that strange location before them
Never going back again
