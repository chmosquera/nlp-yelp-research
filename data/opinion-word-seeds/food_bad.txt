Disappointed they didn't have the variety of breads similar to the Yountville location.
Macaroons were inconsistent, some dry and they didn't seem to have the same texture as the ones I had before.
Granted it comes with soup but the soup (creamy potato) didn't go well with the prosciutto di Parma panini.
