1,4fHMRG2Qbkd144jxIijtyA,2,"Tried this place for the first time,
The environment is fun, bright and the IPod charging station and wi-fi are the only thing I would come back for.
I ordered the BBQ chicken salad, it was all lettuce and literally a teaspoon (NOT tablespoon) of chicken pieces.  The toppings were incredibly small.  $8.00 for a bowl of lettuce isn't going to impress anyone.
I wanted to try the pesto chicken panini, but they only offer white bread, no other healthy or gluten free options.

I came to this place as its really close to work.
I ordered fish tacos..it was 10$ for two.
When ordering she did not tell me they use samon(frm a can) but i guess i should hve asked -_-
She asks if i want special sauce..i ask whats in it.its mustard ketchup and mayo mixed together ..what???
So i pick up the taco to eat it and its so soggy that the whole thing falls apart.
It has absolutely no flavor except the cilantro in my pico de gallo...
Worse food ever.
The place is quite dirty as well i should hve know better.
Definitely will not return!!!

Had the melon salad dish, not bad. The mixed ceviche was my fav. The mixed ceviche piaia wasn't bad with lobster,  chicken and shrimp but didn't seem worth the 50 dollar ticket price. I would have rated this a 3 star spot but for this price I expected it to be better.  I doubt it will be better should I return.

A couple of days prior to my reservation I called to confirm that it was still available which they said it was. When I arrived, they forgot about my reservation and tried to make excuses that they do not take reservations.

7,x4OO89WaK8wGIJkKNlropA,2,"For the record, I have returned a few times and still entirely stand by my original review from nearly 3 years ago. I will add that the food portions also seem to be decreasing! We went during happy hour last week and I had the worst tasting rye drink possible - described as rye with fig jam, bitters and lemon, sounded like something that cannot possibly be fucked up, but tasted like nothing but the juice wrenched out of unripe lemons - super dry and gave me a stomach ache. No fig flavor to be detected. To make matters worse, when my partner tried to ask the bartender about the drink, if it was supposed to be sooo god-aweful lemony, she responded with a ""yes, it's got lemon in it."" When he pressed the issue, she simply repeated, ""yes, it's a lemon and fig drink."" More frustrating than conversations with the wall. The risotto that we ordered was the size one would expect of a side dish (which is what risotto should be, but this was proposed as an entree...). It had about 5 little pieces of maitake mushroom and 6 hazelnuts in it and was otherwise flavorless. We added lots of salt and pepper. Total waste of $25 bucks. 

Also, their bar seating sucks. The chairs are stationary and far away from each other, and a bit far from the bar for a shorty like me; my feet don't reach the foot bar on the chair either, so my legs fall asleep trying to sit there.",1,1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
8,mWhFyqzrNxSuZiV4n5w9ZA,2,"The food is great. Burgers are fresh and delicious. Have been here a few times, but their food service hours are SO INCONSISTENT!
The date is 5\/8 at 10:15pm. My husband called earlier this afternoon to ask what time the kitchen was open until-- they said midnight.
Great! We walk 15 minutes from our house, hungry and excited for delicious burgers. The sign on the door says late night menu until 2am. How convenient for a second shifter!
We walk in and the host grabs menu and walks us to the table, then taps the table with the menus and says to my husband, ""Sorry man, the kitchen's closed.""
We are obviously shocked and so disappointed. He double checks for us. We called and checked. But the kitchen is closed.
I've lived here for 2 years and seen this location have 3 different restaurants. If they cant be consistent with their customers, they will fail.
10 months later...
Food still good, but I get anxiety every time because there is always some issue. On NYE 2016 I had to make a second trip back after my carry-out order was wrong. I know that was months ago, but just 10 minutes ago I received my delivery in which I requested malt vinegar on the side. There's a giant receipt on the bag with my request on it, but of course none in the bag. A missing condiment is a small issue, but it's the little mistakes coupled with the large mistakes that continue to leave my enthusiasm for this restaurant on a roller coaster ride.
TL;DR: Dine in by 9pm, I wouldn't recommend getting carry-out or delivery.",1,0,1,0,1,0,-1,0,0,1

10,bsBPZxWLzmi-HqX_eI2a4g,2,"Well, after reading the reviews, I thought this would be a perfect spot to check out on New Years Eve. The space is lovely. I know that they are known for their service, but to me, it felt forced, not at all genuine and completely over the top.

We ordered the sangria, it was decent. I've had better. The bread came out and it was moldy. Being as I've spent years in food service, I know this can happen unintentionally so I very quietly called over a gentlemen (not our server) and whispered to him that he may want to check the other bread before it goes out and that I wasn't upset at all, just wanted him to know. The server comes rushing over, loud as can be and says something is wrong with the bread, I'll get you a new one right away. I assured him it was no biggie and he wouldn't drop it. Plus it just brought attention to a situation that didn't require attention. So there was that.

I ordered the stuffed shrimp and my husband ordered the paella. The seafood was cooked well and there was enough of it, but the rice was awful. It didn't have the crisp bottom that is what you look for with paella. Literally, we make a better paella at home. It was rather disappointing. The whole experience was just eh. Our bill for those two dishes and a pitcher of sangria was $80 + with tip. Not a lot to spend on a meal on NYE, but not worth it for that meal.",1,1,1,1,-1,1,-1,-1,-1,1

12,Aq9ch0YCqkEOFJM0rKxB3w,2,"I snub my nose at you zealous purists out there. I like my cheese steaks bastardized. Hold your cheese whiz. Drop the beef and toss on some chicken. And make sure to add vegetables. Yes, vegetables. Blasphemy, I know. Give me mushrooms, onions, green peppers, tomatoes. Mmmm. In fact, you could even hold the meat and I would be alright with that. 

The hot sandwiches at Corleone's are a happy medley of these two extremes. For the purists, there's the Philly Original and for us West Coast blasphemers there's everything from Buffalo Chicken to Veggie Subs. The fries are pretty decent (it takes some real effort--or neglect--to fuck up french fries) but the onion rings leave a lot to be desired. 
 
I've tried a couple different hot sandwiches, including the Philly Original, and it's always a greasy, messy event. The majority of the time the juice and grease of the contents melt right through the damn roll, leaving me with a pile of napkins, a mangled sandwich, and a frown on my face. (I really dislike it when my food falls apart. I usually bite of it as hard as I can to try and inflict pain on the offending meal. The food has never acknowledged my attack. It's a pretty irrational tradition.) So if keeping your sandwich in one edible piece is big in your book, I wouldn't recommend this place. 

The actual restaurant is pretty small, with a long bar with stools and several high tables to enjoy your vittles at. It's also a little bit on the hot side since half of the restaurant is the kitchen, and it gets a bit noisy with all the ordering, grilling and chit chat, but it's a really lively atmosphere and they offer delivery or take out if you're in a hurry. They're open really late too, especially on the weekends, in order to cater to the Mill Avenue night life.

On Tuesdays they have a special that's pretty ace. It's a buy one get one deal on any sandwich in the place--of equal or lesser value (just imagine that in small print)--so you and a friend can eat for cheap or you've got one sandwich for dinner and another for lunch the next day.

I know a lot of people that adore this place, but it's just not my thing. Cheese steaks are not the food of gods to me, but if the thought of hot beef and cheese whiz has you gargling saliva like Homer Simpson, you'll probably enjoy it and rate it higher.",1,1,0,1,-1,-1,0,1,-1,1
13,RwZKnDR7Ftj8CCA2Riia_w,2,"Tonight I attended the Yelp mixer organized by Andrew- the rsvp showed 10 people but being the social Yelpers that we are, over 20 people ended up showing up to check out the Vig Uptown.
My friends and I ordered the crab\/artichoke dip, hummus dip, guacamole and salsa, and their chicken flat bread from their happy hour menu.  The food was excellent, everything morsel delicious.
The manager came over several times to see if everything was fine which was great.  What fell short was the service provided by the waiter.
He appeared to be completely overwhelmed by a party of twenty, showing up at various times.  
I was there at 5pm and left around 6:30pm, in that span of time I had one drink.  I saw a drink floating by that looked interesting and managed to flag down the waiter.  He told me the Vig did not serve a drink that I was describing which I saw less than 10 mins prior to speaking to him . . . okay- but he did not ask me if I wanted another drink instead.  In the 1 1\/2 hours that I was there, pretty much everyone had one order of drink even though quite a few of my fellow Yelpers were saying they would like another of their scrumpious alcoholic beverage.  I was there to eat and to drink- I probably would have had 3 drinks, for sure 2 if the waiter had been more on his toes.

Butter chicken sauce heavy on tomato, with chunks of crusty, pan-fried (not stewed) chicken floating in it.

20,G_FGZOpF5HgG-yxW79P7PQ,1,"Decided to stop at the Steak  'n Shake on South Blvd after a afternoon of boating on Lake Wylie. The whole reason we stopped is that online it said that they had ""8"" good Vegetarian choices and since we had a Vegetarian with us, we decided to give it a go. We sat in line for around 15 minutes, but it was fine we were looking at the menu online. But Alas when we got to the order microphone we were unhappy to hear that not one of the ""8"" items they mentioned online did they have. They were supposed to have a Veggie Burger and a Vegetarian Melt. Nope....they had Cheese Fries they said, that's  all. So we had no choice but to order the cheese fries, and we ordered a couple of sandwiches. The cheese fries were just the small order of fries with some Cheese Whiz stuff on them, not hot but cool. I ordered a Frisco Burger which was two white pieces of bread with a couple of paper thin patties on them and a sauce that was like a tomato mayonnaise, the amount of grease was intense. The bread was suppose to be sourdough and thick but it was not. My husband got a Portobello and Swiss burger, his was probably the best, but also almost 7 dollars.

22,1LCpVw3TKDCvWRHwG93QVg,2,"The poke concept is hitting Arizona in waves. 

By no means is this a true Hawaiian style poke, but more of a deconstructed version filled with options such as vegetables, fruit (mango as a protein choice?!?), nacho (what the what?!?), and Asian influenced dressings.

Basically, you follow steps 1-4 and you'll have your shallow tray quickly assembled by the staff. 

Step 1 - Select base and size (small 2 scoops $9, medium 3 scoops $11, large 4 scoops $13)
Step 2 - Select your protein
Step 3 - Select your mix-ins (unlimited, free) and flavor
Step 4 - Select your garnish and sides (unlimited except extra sides and avocado)

On my initial visit, I ordered the medium with brown rice and spring mix, and my choice of 3 scoops of protein (1 tuna, 2 salmon). The staff placed the fish into a stainless steel mixing bowl and added my mix-ins (red\/green onion, jalapeños) and added a package of low sodium soy sauce. With a quick stir, she poured it on top of my green leafy vegetables and cucumbers. I asked to topped it off with masago, shichimi powder and a mini-scoop of the imitation crab meat. 

With my first bite of the tuna, I thought it was passable but the salmon was a little bit more disappointing. The salmon meat did not have a firm texture. In preparing my meal, I noticed the staff had a difficult time scooping it because it seemed excessively wet. 

The prices were slightly inflated compared to other poke places on the West Coast. There were bench and table sitting but majority of the diners took their meals to-go. The ice cream macarons ($3.50) look very appealing but decided to pass. 

My favorites continue to be Poki One N Half (San Diego) and Calipoke (OC) for this type of style, and would consider Poke Bar more like Poke Subpar.",1,0,0,1,-1,0,0,-1,-1,-1

Decor:
Or lack of.  Trying to match the King St W hipster notion and failed big time.

Cleanliness:
Oh where do I start?  How about the floor.  There were mouse trap and sticky pad visible on the floor and around the benches...I wonder why???  Here is an idea, pay an exterminator.  Our water glasses had stuck-on food ON THE INSIDE, when I asked for a new one, the waiter\/owner didn't seem to care or apologetic.  My steak and rice came with a long curly hair which I was not about to digest after seeing the rest of the restaurant.  How they pass the health inspection is beyond me.

Taste:
Fine dining my a$$, tastes more like straight out of the microwave.  There is no creativity that sets aside the food from other places.  And the fusion part, I was looking around to find that.  I ordered the steak, medium rare.  First of all, it looked more like 2 beef patties out of your local Loblaws slapped together.  Second of all, 2 pieces were rare and 1 piece was well done.  Maybe that was their attempt at FUSION??

Service:
It literately took 10 min to just get the menu and another 15 to get water or even attention at the table.  We bought a Groupon and the server didn't even seem to know what menu we are suppose to pick from.  The Groupon clearly said ANY wine upto $9\/glass but the server INSISTED that it was only the $6 house-wine.

You would think that Westin, one of the better brands of hotels in the Starwood family, would go all out for their only Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Top shelf to attract both the business travelers who have learned to rely on Westin's level of service, and the casual traveller, who wants a good hotel near the strip. 

They missed on both.

This Westin can't make up its mind between being a business hotel and a Vegas hotel. It has a very small casino, with 1 crap table, a few table games, and some slots, but virtually nobody playing. The crap table never opened. 

And the rooms are small and very much business like, versus Vegas like in size, decor and style. 

And although Westin has only owned this porperty for less than 6 years, it is already showing age around the edges, losing any freshness or swank it might have had at opening. It just doesn't have a crisp feel like many other Westins in major cities have. 

And right now, the city is doing major construction work on this section of Flamingo Road, so getting in and out of here is a hassle. 

If you want a business hotel in Vegas, I suggest you try Embassy Suites on Paradise. And if you want a more resort like hotel that is reasonable, try the Hilton Grand Vacation properties (there are 3 in Vegas). EIther can be had for under $150. OR get those internet deals from the major Casino Hotels, which are offering some great deals. Like the Venetian mid-week for $69, or many others for under $100.

39,tK_hlz7LrG_mzeBaUuF_4A,2,"I don't know if we went on an off night (I have read other reviews from the night we went that complained about the service as well).  But, to say I was underwhelmed with Bazaar Meat is an understatement.  When we walked in, I was blown away.  It's a dark and very chic looking place.  There is a small casino to your left as you walk in.  I can't believe other restaurants haven't thought of this, it's such a fantastic idea.  I've seen them in clubs, but not restaurants.  Waiting for your table, how about dropping a hundred at roulette?  

The hostesses were very friendly and we were seated right away.  We had drink orders taken very quickly.  So far, so good.  This place is really an assault on the senses.  There are smells from the grilling, the music is loud, there are alligator heads on the wall, and employees everywhere.  The kitchen is very busy, and you can see most of it from the seating area.  Our server started off friendly, and stayed friendly, but he also stayed away from our table.  This is one of the reasons I am giving 2 stars.  As the meal wore on, he was nowhere to be seen.  It took nearly a half hour to get our check.  Also, a table 2 tables from us remained unbussed for over 20 minutes.  I know you are crowded, it's a new hot restaurant on the Strip, but these are issues that shouldn't happened at a place of this caliber charging what they charge.  Most telling, two in my party ordered cocktails when we sat down.  The glasses remained on the table after they were completed, empty, for the entire 2.5 hour meal.  This would have been an easy fix, yet there they remained.  It became kind of a joke with us to see how long they would last.  Spoiler alert:  they were on the table when we left.  For all I know, they still are.

As other yelpers note, the menu is not your typical steakhouse.  It was described to us as a steakhouse meets a tapas place.  I would agree, this is a spot on description.  We started with the Iberico ham, the best ham in the world.  For $70 you don't even get 2 ounces (see my picture), but it's the best HAM IN THE WORLD.  I never regret buying this stuff, and it was no different at Bazaar Meat.  It is served with crustinis with tomato spread on them, sort of a Spanish bruschetta.  The whole thing is fantastic, highly recommended, but it ain't cheap folks.  We next went with the chicken croquettes.  You get 5-6 per order for $12, and they were fantastic.  Fried perfectly and lots of béchamel flavor.  Loved these things, I could have easily eaten another order.  

A couple at our table ordered the famous foie gras cotton candy.  I didn't try it, they ate it so quickly.  I regretted getting one, but we had other things on our mind....

Like the steaks.  Unfortunately, they were out of the Lindsay Ranch ribeye, which of course I'd had my eye on since making the reservation.  As a result, we went with the Mishiwa Reserve, which is $65 a pound.  Supposedly, our steak weighed 2.5 pounds.  Now, I don't carry a scale with me to dinner, but there is no way this thing weighed 40 ounces.  But, we were hungry, and we ate it rather than complaining.  We did point it out to our server, but he said he had no way of knowing since we started eating.  He's absolutely right, but we still weren't happy with the size of this steak.  I don't know, maybe the bone weighs in at 22 ounces or something.  Also, this is the worst dry aged steak I've eaten.  It didn't have the depth of flavor you expect with dry aging.  Additionally, it wasn't adequately seasoned.  This was a fairly big error on such an expensive steak at a restaurant like this.  We ate the steak because we were hungry (and paid an arm and a leg for it), but we weren't happy.

We also tried the quarter of a suckling pig.  Now we're talking!  This thing was as advertised: juicy, flavorful, with that great crispy skin.  We got as much meat off of the thing as we could, but all of us could have used more.  

For sides, we went with the Delmonico potatoes, asparagus, and carrots.  All were good, the potatoes were almost too decadent (if such a state exists).  The asparagus is small, but it was cooked well.  I could have used more flavor from the romesco sauce.  The carrots with pepper and Greek yogurt was probably the table favorite.  I'd absolutely get this dish again.

We were given a small plate of desserts gratis at the end of our meal.  They, like the rest of the meal, were hit and miss.

Overall, I'd say this is an ambitious and unique addition to the fine dining scene in Las Vegas.  I don't know if we went on a bad night (as noted above, I've seen at least one other review that dined the night we did, November 15, 2014, that complained about the service).  I also know restaurants grow and even the best places have issues.  But, for what we paid, a lot of the things are close to inexcusable.  I'd return, but not for a long time, and I will definitely bring a scale....",1,1,1,1,0,1,-1,-1,-1,1

    So if in Pittsburgh, you throw caution and your diet to the winds and try a Primant Bros sandwich. In town for a Pittsburgh fottball weekend, (Panthers-ND, Steelers- Bills and even Slippery Rock-Seton Hill) our first stop after the hotel is the famous PB, within walking distance and smack dab on the fringe of Pitt's campus.
    
     Over time Ive learned to trust my inner voice. ""Buy this stock, its a great investment"" or ""Marry her, it'll work out"".  Sometimes I go against it, with rationale like ""eat it, you've had worse"", or  ""so what if I'm husband number five?""   Well, sitting down at PB's I had a naggin feeling to get the capicola or the pastrami...Not a naggaing feeling, more of a screaming ""GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!"" vibe going on.. Nice atmosphere, easily navigatable menu,  (""GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!"") a good mix of beers, TV's all around the room.  This is a Pitt landmark, gotta take in the full experience (""GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!"").

      So here's the waiter ,a  fine and friendly fellow and I can hear my mouth and brain arguing. (Mouth: ""Get the number 2, I dont care, I hate this guy anyway from last nights tofu""..  Brain: ""We're paying for this, jerk, get what you really want"") Mouth wins and I order the hamburger patty with the requisite fries, colesalw, tomatoes and thick sliced Italian bread.  The rationale? Its their #2 seller, after beer!

     The food comes and it only take 2 bites to chastise my brain for not taking charge  (""GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!""). The coleslaw makes the fries cold, and the hamburger patty well, I'll be kind.  Imagine taking off your shoe, taking out the inner sole, placing it on the grill for 3 minues, them placing it into a  sandwich...Bland, over done, totally buried by everything else in the sandwich. No amount of ketchup could save it..   (""GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!"")   I probably should have just taken it out and eaten a cole slaw\/fries sandwich...

Of course while I'm eating, (well enduring is more like it) the sandwich, the next table orders the pastrami....It looked deleicious, hearty, tasteful. My one time to eat at PB's and I choose (like the guy in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) poorly. I wont slam Primanti Bros with one star because I had alternatives and only one visit. (Note to Brain: Stand up for yourself!. Dont let the Mouth make all the decisions, he only works here, you're supposed to be running the place!..)   

If in Pittsburgh again, I will try PB's again. And I will get, all togther now:  THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!",1,0,1,0,-1,0,1,0,0,1

I ended up there on the last day of Yelp Eats with a group of friends in a craving for Italian. From what I saw on their menu, I was very excited to see what was i store for me and had heard pretty decent things. I walked out not that excited. 

The ambiance inside is very nice, though a bit on the dark side. The decor inside told a completely different story than what I was thinking when I saw the entrance. It is very posh inside and I did like the comfy booths.

We arrived early enough to get the early bird special, which appeared to be a better deal than the yelp eats one. I wonder if this was truly our best choice. 

For me when it comes to pasta, I am a bit picky. This mainly comes from the fact that I don't like really heavy sauces and I really do not like tomatoes. It has to be a good Italian place and not your run of the mill to get me excited.

My first course was a Caesar salad. Wait take that back. That was supposed to be my first course. I believe I really got romaine lettuce, croutons and dressing of the day. It definitely was *not* Caesar. This left me sad. The bread with it though was pretty damn good although I suggest bigger bottles of balsamic. We ran out fast! 

My main course was chicken marsala and a side of penne. The penne came with a paste (note I did not say sauce) and seemed a little dry and bland. The chicken marsala was actually decent but pretty run of the mill and nothing spectacular. 

Dessert involved two mini cannolis. Like the pasta, they seemed a little dry and lacking, but were flavorful.

This isn't the first time I've had bad service at this location, but it was the worst customer service experience I've ever had. In  speaking to others they have also shared their experiences with poor customer service at this location.  I live in Goodyear so it's unfortunate. I had a waitress who first thought it excusable to not wait my table for more than 20 minutes after being seated, then she tried lie by saying she wasn't our waitress, to make maters worse she claimed my husband was cursing at her(which he never even gave a tone like he was using foul language) and the worst part is she continued to harass us by returning to our table after I had requested the manager. I finally decided to walk to the counter to ask for the manager myself she followed me continuing to harass me. The manager wasn't much better.  His Initial response was his response to my email and his response was very nice but I felt he was more concerned with making excuses for his employee. He was checking with the host to see if maybe tables were switched on her or something that could have thrown her off. I don't think that should matter, regardless of the reason, there should be no excuse for that type of behavior. He did apologized and asked if there was anything he could do for us. I was not looking for handouts,  but in my past experience with poor service, the management has never asked me if there is anything they could do for me. Instead they took the initiative to try and make things right. Then I received an email response which stated ""We strive very hard to make orders correct the first time, but we are only human and we sometimes make mistakes."" This was spilled water, that would be a mistake. This was behavior issues. There is so much more I could say but I won't.

I went here for the Summerlicious lunch. Upon entering the restaurant, I was impressed at how spacious it was! 

Normally for Summerlicious, I tend to pick the most expensive main course so it will worth the money lol. With that said, this time I chose the ravioli as my main since the steak will probably give me itis after lunch :(.

Overall thought: lunch was okay, but not spectacular. None of the items on their lunch menu jumped out to me as special. Since we had 12 people, there was also a service charge so our bill came to almost $40... which were probably the most expensive lunch I ever had.

-East Coast Seafood Escabeche: 
The seafood was cooked perfectly, and by marinating them in vinegar and olive oil, it gave the seafood a deliciously sharp tang. The watermelon and capers toned down the tanginess of the seafood with theirs sweetness and saltiness flavors, respectively. However, I felt the chili was not needed as the dish turned out to be too spicy. Don't get me wrong, I love spicy food but the heat from the chili lingered in my mouth, and prevented me from tasting other flavors.

-Lemon Basil Ravioli: 
The ravioli had a perfect ratio of fillings to dough, and I believe the filling was ricotta cheese, yum! Unfortunately there were only 2 dots of the lemon basil sauce on the plate, hence I couldn't taste the sauce at all :(. The tomato ragout was just like any other regular tomato pasta sauce that I could have made. Also, I'm not sure why there were a few pieces of candied walnuts as they didn't go well with the savory ravioli at all... 

-Corn meal crusted Halibut: 
Friend loved it but the halibut was overcooked. Moreover, for me anything crusted with cornmeal is pretty much tasteless, so I was expecting the sauce to deliver a big punch of flavor, but I was quite disappointed...

-Strawberry Bavarois: 
I didn't get to try, but my friend seemed to enjoy it. I was quite curious of how the black pepper would go with the bavarois though

-Triple Layered Chocolate Mousse: 
I ordered the mousse and it was not overly sweetened, however it wasn't bad nor awful. The mousse itself had a dense texture and strong chocolate flavor. The first layer was jello or something, I just can't quite put my finger on it but it was good! The top layer was tangy and really helped to cut down the rich chocolate mousse.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,-1,-1,1

The only thing is when I got there, only one customer was in the store sitting down eating her soup of the day, which she was raving about (Manish Water). Apparently they have a different soup daily. and my food was not prepared and I came 15mins or so after I called which is plenty of time to scoop food into a container -_-
Customer Service is there but don't expect conversations or anything more than your total .. I mean your paying less than 20 bucks for take out, this isn't some dine in restaurant where you are waited on. 
The restaurant is located off of King street, when you turn onto king street from Hurontario you will actually drive past the doors w 3 lil steps up.. you can barely see the sign but it is right beside a Hakka Chinese food place also with the name Freddy.turn into the first lot and walk back onto King st for the front door.
So I ordered a small oxtail (16$) and a lunch special fried chicken (8$), when I got there like I said my food wasn't prepared and I saw the price list 2$ more for a large oxtail so I told her just give me the large (not much difference only bigger container). I did find it a bit pricey I mean 18$, i don't know. 
The fried chicken was def worth the 8$, the chicken has a slight redish coating which I've never seen before not sure what they use that gives it that colour but tasted amazing and fresh. The oxtail on the other hand was quite rubbery and lots of fat. however the flavor was amazing , glad I got lots of gravy on my rice. Love that they do it with the butter beans (white lima beans), adds extra flavor. As i said it did all taste great but for the price\/portion size\/ fat-meat ratio I wouldn't spend 18$ .

It is located in the Place Longueuil shopping mall on the South Shore off St. Laurent, not too far from the Pont Jacques-Cartier. 

Todai is known in California for it's all you can eat sushi in mass quantities, buffet style. PF Chang's, that Scottsdale, AZ HQ'd Chinese chain, is known for its large faux statues. Sushi Palace combines these. 

The place is very large, seating over 100 people, maybe up to 200 if you used every seat. The space has high ceilings and is airy, with large columns covered with ancient Chinese calligraphy, and above the sushi counter and kitchen, large Buddha statues on the upper half of the wall. These are not Japanese looking Buddhas, but skinnier Chinese looking ones. Nonetheless, they add to the PF Chang likeness of the massive horses they use in front of those faux Chinese eateries. 

And speaking of faux, this is faux Japanese, as it is owned and staffed with Chinese. And although it is an AYCE place, it is not a buffet. You sit, get a waiter, order off little sushi or other item check lists, and they go order it for you from the cooks\/chefs under the Buddhas. 

They do have a large selection and variety of foods. They carry most common Nigiri sushi items (except Uni and other more exotics), and some sashimi as well. And they offer other popular Japanese dishes like Yakitori au Boeuf and Tempura aux Crevettes. Actually, they have 5 different Yakitoris and Tempura selections. 

But if you feel like mixing your Japanese with Chinese, try the Poisson Szechuannais ou L'agneau Mongolien. Thinking about noodles? They have Pad Thai au Poulet ou Boeuf, ou Udon.  They even have on Vendredis et Samedis la Cuisine Chaude, ""Boulettes de Pieuvre"" ou Takoyaki! And being in Quebec, they offer Escargots Gratines. Oh, and if you want a little flavor of Korea, order the Kimchi! No Poutine, though!

I didn't have a chance to see much of the inside as it was so gorgeous out, I couldn't help but sit on the patio. However, I love the look and feel. It feels homey and comfortable, but almost like your home is in the middle of a tiny forest. 

The food was good. Between our appetizer and our food we left completely stuffed. For a main dish I had to try the much deliberated mac and cheese. While it wasn't the best I've ever had, it was good and a great fit for the night. I paired it with, well, a glass of Kung Fu Girl Riesling... suits me well I think. My visitor had one of the sandwiches with chips and found it perfect. 

The service was on par except for when it came to get our bill. Then, we sat there for 10 minutes and had to flag him down. Additionally, our appetizer came out at the same time as our main dishes.

My buddy and I ate here for lunch upon arriving into town on a Thursday afternoon.  There were only 2 other tables with diners, so we were immediately seated.  After ordering our drinks, we perused the menu.  It was an Oyster Bar, so I was expecting some New Orleans beers like Abita or Blackened Voodoo Lager.  No dice, it was all pretty basic stuff.  They have a full bar, so we had cocktails.  Our server was attentive but not overbearing.  No complaints there.

I went with the New England (the only kind) clam chowder and the parmesan crusted halibut.  The soup was good, it had nice big chunks of clam and potatoes.  It needed pepper and Tabasco, but I have found that most clam chowders are on the bland side, so this wasn't a surprise.  I'd order this again.  Likewise, my fish was cooked really well.  It was flaky and not overdone, and the parmesan crust was tasty, but I could have used more.  It was in a cream sauce that was BEGGING for seasoning.  This was superfluous, all it did was make the dish wet.  But, the spinach on the side was seasoned very well.  One of the better spinach dishes I can remember having.  If I were to order this again, I would ask for no sauce.

My buddy ordered the blackened scallops in a Cajun cream sauce over pasta.  When it arrived, I was jealous.  It looked FANTASTIC.  I immediately regretted my order.  But, when he tasted it, there was no flavor to the cream.  It was colored as though it had lots of pepper in it, but it was only cream.  It was actually impressive how something that looked so good could taste so bland.  So, he picked out the scallops and ate them.  The server noticed he didn't eat the pasta and asked him why.  When he told the server the issue, the server offered him another entrée.  My buddy declined, so the server got him a gratis cocktail.  I think the dish should have been taken off the bill entirely, but at least he made some gesture.  I'd eat here again, but absolutely wouldn't order that ""Cajun"" pasta.",1,0,1,0,-1,0,0,0,-1,1

It was so full of flavor and a very large portion. It was packed with plenty of crawfish and crab. 

Luckily our server explained the heat ratings to us because he said it was 1-10 and I immediately said we want 6. Well, their 6 is not what I was thinking because he said a 3 is tabasco sauce! We went with 3 on both dishes and it had just the right amount of heat.

I have always loved their pizza but I have been pleasantly surprised at how good everything else I have tried is. I know they had a rough start with the food but it seems like they've got it right now. I have never been disappointed with anything I have ordered.

I have really noticed improvement in the lounge. They have a good beer selection and a much cooler crowd then in the past.

Delux was one of the first restaurants I went to upon moving to Phoenix and I have gone back a few times since, mainly at lunch during the work week. It's my favorite burger spot. 

The atmosphere is slightly on the pretentious side. However, it's very small and pretty cramped. Even at lunch during the week it can feel cramped at a table and there's a big chance of waiting in line awhile. I've sat both inside and outside and felt a little too close to the other tables. It's a little complicated with bigger groups also.

The food however is amazing. I always get the same thing, a delux burger and sweet potato fries. I don't care if you are scared of medium rare, you need to try this thing. It's one of the most amazing burger's I've had and I can never finish the entire thing. I'd love to have a mini one. That would be perfect. A regular order of fries comes in an adorable metal mini shopping cart. Also good to note is that by default you do not get just ketchup with your fries. Being a non tomato eater, it's nice to not have to remember to ask for another dipping sauce. 

Oh the beer list you ask? Phenomenal. Being able to order a red velvet always makes me happy. Unique beer flights make me happy also. 

I never have room for dessert while I'm there but I did have a friend order the cookies they brag about one time. It was rather hard and I wasn't impressed. That cookie should have been soft and chewy and full of deliciousness.

The sushi is fresh and they have many creative types of sushi (there was one that was wrapped in cucumber which was amazing). The salt and pepper shrimp was fantastic, along with the pepper beef and tempuras. The service was also very good, the food came quickly and the waitress came to check on us every 5 minutes.

110,j-WxzsE4pdjgyrGkp2pIlg,4,"We showed up for dinner around 6pm on a Wednesday night and we were the only people in the restaurant. I usually would turn around and leave anywhere else, but there are not that many Lebanese restaurants in Vegas, so I decided to give it a go.

Apps:
It was happy hour between 4 and 7, so most of the apps were 1\/2 off. We ordered fattoush, tabouli, hummus, baba ganoush, meat grape leaves, and veggie grape leaves.  Everything was pretty good except the tabouli had too much dressing and could have been mixed with some more bulgar wheat. The fattoush was pretty good and it had enough sumac in it too. Some people don't put enough sumac in their fattoush.

Iced Tea - I think they put rose water in their tea. It was pretty good.

Entrees:
 Chicken shawarma plate. It came with hummus and real Lebanese style garlic sauce. The chicken was not cooked on the proper vertical rotisserie, but it was spiced properly and it tasted very good.

Lamb Kabob - my daughter ordered it well done, so she basically ruined the meat, so I didn't bother to try it. It was a nice presentation though with the rice and veggies.

Falafel plate - they were good. Served with the traditional tahini sauce.

The service was great. It should be, we were the only customers there. The dining room decor reminded me of the Arabic restaurants back home in Dearborn from the 80's. I liked it. Some might find it a bit dated though. I don't know why it was not busy, but I recommend you stop by and try some Lebanese cuisine. I think you will enjoy Ali BaBa's.",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1

This restaurant is quite a distance from my home but I am happy to make the drive to satisfy my shabu craving!  THIS RESTAURANT IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST!  so much so, that despite the wait for my food that I sometimes experience here they still receive five stars from me!

Geisha
Half sukiyaki
Half tonkotsu

How I eat it?
Extra garlic and raddish in the sukiyaki
Cook meat in sukiyaki
Cook udon and veggies in tonkotsu

For dessert I shared the Kinafa with my husband, which I found out is a Lebanese dessert. Made with a light pastry crust, ricotta cheese and pistachios sprinkled on top. Nice and light. I would order it all again.

Just had a few rolls all of which were fine.  3 of the 4 rolls were about the size as a coffee cup, way too big for a humans mouth.  So what's a person do with rolls that are too big?

Do you: 

A) Push the entire roll in you pie-hole and hope no food falls out when you start chewing.
B) Cut up the roll with a knife and fork.
C) Use your chopsticks to pick apart the roll into small bite size portions.

I came back a few weeks later with a friend and ate inside. The place was not busy yet we had to wait for a table, then were seated at a small table that had rips along the seats. This isn't a deal breaker but certainly didn't leave a good first impression. Service was slow, our waiter was very quiet and hard to understand.

121,1vNU_TwadDFk-w4iMfdfbw,3,"I am trying not to let the bad press or a friend's huge fan love sway my review. Therefore, this breakfast joint is middle of the road. When a friend first mentioned heading here for lunch, I was curious, and after reading reviews. I was scared. But I trust said friend, and allowed myself to be led in blindly to another Two Hippies joint. 

Here are items that were factored into this 3-star rating:

** First and foremost, I didn't love it, but I most certainly didn't hate it either. If someone wanted to go back, I would agree. There are a few more things on the menu that intrigue me enough to want to try them.

** I didn't like the decor as much as their pizza joint. It was too much on the stoner side of hippie.. to a nauseating degree. Then there was this random old stove that didn't scream hippie at all. I personally prefer happy hippie. Oooh now there's an awesome alliteration. And another. BAM!

** The green chile burger I got was pretty damn good. I wish the heat was kicked up a few notches, but it was solid. I was so pleased I nearly swallowed that thing whole.

** They have the lemonade I love. I tried mango this time. Not as good as blood orange, but still solid.

** I did not find the breakfast menu so appealing I wanted it instead of lunch. This was a disappointment. I also heard they don't serve breakfast all day, though one of the people I was dining with did get breakfast. I think we were there around 1pm if I remember correctly.

** The fries were terrible. I love crinkle fries but these were so dry I was unable to enjoy them. Fries aren't supposed to be healthy. Give me the grease. Even adding sauce to them (I tried sriracha) did no good. I will never have fries there again.",1,1,0,0,-1,-1,0,0,-1,1
122,KGQoAEq6O9PFOPBFUN0ykA,3,"I should probably be more generous with the stars here because I eat there often but there are just too many better burrito joints in the city.

This location is down the street from me so I go often due to my burrito addiction. I basically always get the lil (their smallest size) bean and cheese on whole wheat. Same order I get at Burrito Bandidos but this place just gets something wrong along the way.

Beans are tasty and smokey in flavour, they offer chow mein along with the rice but I usually skip it. Bit too much starch for my liking. Then they have the usual toppings that I indulge in - lettuce, pico de gallo, jalapeno, cilantro, peppers, salsa, sour cream, burrito sauce (it's very tasty here), but they also have coleslaw which I think is gross and the vinegar dressing takes over and runs throughout the burrito. They also will crunch up some chips in there which is kind of a nice touch. Watch out for the hot sauce, I ask for a little bit which can vary depending on the person making it but it is extremely spicy. My husband likes the burn so he goes for it.

They grill the burritos which I also appreciate but again it never comes out like Bandidos. 

Try the Blair's Death Rain chips if you want to ruin your night and your taste buds!

The decor in the bathroom is expensive, mimicking a Japanese ancient Castle, with large cuts on stone masonry, copper pots for sinks, and metal tubes to look like large bamboo as the faucets. 

The next best thing is the large stone in the middle of the room. It is a large rock with a spotlight on it, and mimicks a Japanese rock garden.

The third best thing is the out door patio seating, with the misters going full blast as the tempurature still hovers around 100 at 11:00pm in August. There are several tables out there, and also some couches.

The 4th best thing is the Pachinko machines in the entryway, brightly lit and real, However, as the cute hostess will tell you, she has no balls (for the pachinko machines, stupid!)

The 5th best thing is their large drink menu of specialty drinks. I didn't look in there for an ""Orgasm"" or a ""SloeComfortableScrew Against the Wall"", or other ridiculous concoctions, etc.
