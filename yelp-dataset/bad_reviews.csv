MlctEhsBk5RPv9GrZVxm2w,1,"Food was disgusting and my chicken was under cooked, our waitresses was clueless and took forever!",,,,,,,,
4fHMRG2Qbkd144jxIijtyA,2,"Tried this place for the first time,
The environment is fun, bright and the IPod charging station and wi-fi are the only thing I would come back for.
I ordered the BBQ chicken salad, it was all lettuce and literally a teaspoon (NOT tablespoon) of chicken pieces.  The toppings were incredibly small.  $8.00 for a bowl of lettuce isn't going to impress anyone.
I wanted to try the pesto chicken panini, but they only offer white bread, no other healthy or gluten free options.
I was excited to try this place but walked out VERY disappointed.  Won't be back or recommend to anyone until they get real!!",,,,,,,,
Kd2Y2Jbzn7DwF4JMdbX-Zg,1,"Ive been on the hunt for a good local fish taco and so far nothing.
I came to this place as its really close to work.
I ordered fish tacos..it was 10$ for two.
When ordering she did not tell me they use samon(frm a can) but i guess i should hve asked -_-
She asks if i want special sauce..i ask whats in it.its mustard ketchup and mayo mixed together ..what???
So i pick up the taco to eat it and its so soggy that the whole thing falls apart.
It has absolutely no flavor except the cilantro in my pico de gallo...
Worse food ever.
The place is quite dirty as well i should hve know better.
Definitely will not return!!!
Not sure how they got these ratings",,,,,,,,
96nYOXIY33_kScuuq4Dyzg,2,"Was underwhelmed by this place. Always thought it would be cool often walking by it at Aria. Service was solid but food took a long time. Had the melon salad dish, not bad. The mixed ceviche was my fav. The mixed ceviche piaia wasn't bad with lobster,  chicken and shrimp but didn't seem worth the 50 dollar ticket price. I would have rated this a 3 star spot but for this price I expected it to be better.  I doubt it will be better should I return. Firefly, Yonaka Japanese style or even, Hawaiian inspired 808 tapas was much better.",,,,,,,,
dmUQO0S4u-hU4W2ndxqOSA,1,"If you ever wonder how bad fast food can get, come to Avondale. They've put us off Panda Express indefinitely due to:
1.) Incompetent help
2.) TERRIBLE food
3.) Creating the impression #1 and #2 are what people want, apparently in lieu of food.
And yes, we've contacted mgmt.",,,,,,,,
TnapIgdOmFhTlmtmsWwPuA,2,"I had a completely disappointing experience on my last visit because of their service. I made reservations over 2 weeks ago for the private room that seats 20 on table. A couple of days prior to my reservation I called to confirm that it was still available which they said it was. When I arrived, they forgot about my reservation and tried to make excuses that they do not take reservations. We pointed out our reservations on the list and advised that we have booked the room before. I am giving them 2 stars because the food was still good.",,,,,,,,
6u1M7t0B_tSl_4M1pqiufA,2,"Wanted to love it because I like the decor and the location is great. They need to improve the food. I had chicken burritos and there was little chicken and dry crunchy rice. The wait staff was great. My companion had tacos and said there were dry also. With a few culinary improvements they would be great. It appeared they trying for a fancy taco experience and it wasn't a good fit.

New review a year later....much better food. Had the happy hour and the chicken taco Tinga. Much improved!",,,,,,,,
x4OO89WaK8wGIJkKNlropA,2,"For the record, I have returned a few times and still entirely stand by my original review from nearly 3 years ago. I will add that the food portions also seem to be decreasing! We went during happy hour last week and I had the worst tasting rye drink possible - described as rye with fig jam, bitters and lemon, sounded like something that cannot possibly be fucked up, but tasted like nothing but the juice wrenched out of unripe lemons - super dry and gave me a stomach ache. No fig flavor to be detected. To make matters worse, when my partner tried to ask the bartender about the drink, if it was supposed to be sooo god-aweful lemony, she responded with a ""yes, it's got lemon in it."" When he pressed the issue, she simply repeated, ""yes, it's a lemon and fig drink."" More frustrating than conversations with the wall. The risotto that we ordered was the size one would expect of a side dish (which is what risotto should be, but this was proposed as an entree...). It had about 5 little pieces of maitake mushroom and 6 hazelnuts in it and was otherwise flavorless. We added lots of salt and pepper. Total waste of $25 bucks. 

Also, their bar seating sucks. The chairs are stationary and far away from each other, and a bit far from the bar for a shorty like me; my feet don't reach the foot bar on the chair either, so my legs fall asleep trying to sit there.",,,,,,,,
mWhFyqzrNxSuZiV4n5w9ZA,2,"The food is great. Burgers are fresh and delicious. Have been here a few times, but their food service hours are SO INCONSISTENT!
The date is 5\/8 at 10:15pm. My husband called earlier this afternoon to ask what time the kitchen was open until-- they said midnight.
Great! We walk 15 minutes from our house, hungry and excited for delicious burgers. The sign on the door says late night menu until 2am. How convenient for a second shifter!
We walk in and the host grabs menu and walks us to the table, then taps the table with the menus and says to my husband, ""Sorry man, the kitchen's closed.""
We are obviously shocked and so disappointed. He double checks for us. We called and checked. But the kitchen is closed.
I've lived here for 2 years and seen this location have 3 different restaurants. If they cant be consistent with their customers, they will fail.
10 months later...
Food still good, but I get anxiety every time because there is always some issue. On NYE 2016 I had to make a second trip back after my carry-out order was wrong. I know that was months ago, but just 10 minutes ago I received my delivery in which I requested malt vinegar on the side. There's a giant receipt on the bag with my request on it, but of course none in the bag. A missing condiment is a small issue, but it's the little mistakes coupled with the large mistakes that continue to leave my enthusiasm for this restaurant on a roller coaster ride.
TL;DR: Dine in by 9pm, I wouldn't recommend getting carry-out or delivery.",,,,,,,,
UbdppJ3ygDGunuL0Weyezw,2,"So the family would like me to start off by saying wouldn't it be nice if the servers smiled at least once. Oh yes and why are they so stingy with the butter. Oh and when did they change their menu. 
I guess we shouldn't expect good things to remain good forever, but we can dream. We used to enjoy The Good Egg but now......well.....meh. Wish we still liked it but, no.",,,,,,,,
bsBPZxWLzmi-HqX_eI2a4g,2,"Well, after reading the reviews, I thought this would be a perfect spot to check out on New Years Eve. The space is lovely. I know that they are known for their service, but to me, it felt forced, not at all genuine and completely over the top.

We ordered the sangria, it was decent. I've had better. The bread came out and it was moldy. Being as I've spent years in food service, I know this can happen unintentionally so I very quietly called over a gentlemen (not our server) and whispered to him that he may want to check the other bread before it goes out and that I wasn't upset at all, just wanted him to know. The server comes rushing over, loud as can be and says something is wrong with the bread, I'll get you a new one right away. I assured him it was no biggie and he wouldn't drop it. Plus it just brought attention to a situation that didn't require attention. So there was that.

I ordered the stuffed shrimp and my husband ordered the paella. The seafood was cooked well and there was enough of it, but the rice was awful. It didn't have the crisp bottom that is what you look for with paella. Literally, we make a better paella at home. It was rather disappointing. The whole experience was just eh. Our bill for those two dishes and a pitcher of sangria was $80 + with tip. Not a lot to spend on a meal on NYE, but not worth it for that meal.",,,,,,,,
Dcx6vvACXkYKqeG0iThTVw,1,"The food was so oily. Taste strong, maybe lots of SMG. Service was poor, and I will not come again.",,,,,,,,
Aq9ch0YCqkEOFJM0rKxB3w,2,"I snub my nose at you zealous purists out there. I like my cheese steaks bastardized. Hold your cheese whiz. Drop the beef and toss on some chicken. And make sure to add vegetables. Yes, vegetables. Blasphemy, I know. Give me mushrooms, onions, green peppers, tomatoes. Mmmm. In fact, you could even hold the meat and I would be alright with that. 

The hot sandwiches at Corleone's are a happy medley of these two extremes. For the purists, there's the Philly Original and for us West Coast blasphemers there's everything from Buffalo Chicken to Veggie Subs. The fries are pretty decent (it takes some real effort--or neglect--to fuck up french fries) but the onion rings leave a lot to be desired. 
 
I've tried a couple different hot sandwiches, including the Philly Original, and it's always a greasy, messy event. The majority of the time the juice and grease of the contents melt right through the damn roll, leaving me with a pile of napkins, a mangled sandwich, and a frown on my face. (I really dislike it when my food falls apart. I usually bite of it as hard as I can to try and inflict pain on the offending meal. The food has never acknowledged my attack. It's a pretty irrational tradition.) So if keeping your sandwich in one edible piece is big in your book, I wouldn't recommend this place. 

The actual restaurant is pretty small, with a long bar with stools and several high tables to enjoy your vittles at. It's also a little bit on the hot side since half of the restaurant is the kitchen, and it gets a bit noisy with all the ordering, grilling and chit chat, but it's a really lively atmosphere and they offer delivery or take out if you're in a hurry. They're open really late too, especially on the weekends, in order to cater to the Mill Avenue night life.

On Tuesdays they have a special that's pretty ace. It's a buy one get one deal on any sandwich in the place--of equal or lesser value (just imagine that in small print)--so you and a friend can eat for cheap or you've got one sandwich for dinner and another for lunch the next day.

I know a lot of people that adore this place, but it's just not my thing. Cheese steaks are not the food of gods to me, but if the thought of hot beef and cheese whiz has you gargling saliva like Homer Simpson, you'll probably enjoy it and rate it higher.",,,,,,,,
RwZKnDR7Ftj8CCA2Riia_w,2,"Tonight I attended the Yelp mixer organized by Andrew- the rsvp showed 10 people but being the social Yelpers that we are, over 20 people ended up showing up to check out the Vig Uptown.
My friends and I ordered the crab\/artichoke dip, hummus dip, guacamole and salsa, and their chicken flat bread from their happy hour menu.  The food was excellent, everything morsel delicious.
The manager came over several times to see if everything was fine which was great.  What fell short was the service provided by the waiter.
He appeared to be completely overwhelmed by a party of twenty, showing up at various times.  
I was there at 5pm and left around 6:30pm, in that span of time I had one drink.  I saw a drink floating by that looked interesting and managed to flag down the waiter.  He told me the Vig did not serve a drink that I was describing which I saw less than 10 mins prior to speaking to him . . . okay- but he did not ask me if I wanted another drink instead.  In the 1 1\/2 hours that I was there, pretty much everyone had one order of drink even though quite a few of my fellow Yelpers were saying they would like another of their scrumpious alcoholic beverage.  I was there to eat and to drink- I probably would have had 3 drinks, for sure 2 if the waiter had been more on his toes.
So no more than 2 stars for lack of service . . .",,,,,,,,
A8I_ACE_eC76m8kG5Zj1Lw,2,"10\/22\/2011 was the date of our visit.  Food was just okay, server was just okay.  The manager climbed up on the food prep counter to fix a light.  We felt like that was the most unsanitary thing anyone could do - he could have just come from the restroom for all we knew.  Needless to say, lackluster service, mediocre food and lack of concern for the cleanliness of the food prep area will guarantee we will NEVER return.",,,,,,,,
R0EX1sFwLGM0Lyr0Q-6iYg,1,"Bad, Bad and really BAD. Dry burgers.  Cheese does not taste like cheese.  Expensive, for dry burgers.

Burgers taste like precooked.  Frozen or cheap fast food burgers taste better then the burgers at this location.

On the plus side, service was good.",,,,,,,,
q4TSJCUvKUp5XnaPa-rpqw,2,"Disappointed. Ordered the preset package. The tea is served in a clear pot. Was cheap looking and not even half full.  It wasn't hot enough either.   The rum cake was absolutely awful in smell taste and texture.  Only 3 items were decent, the scone, deviled egg and the hazelnut tart.  I like the pineapple jam and clotted cream. 

It was a good thing we only ordered one set for the both of us.  We would have ordered another pot of tea but we were so turned of by the food items.  I've had better afternoon tea elsewhere for cheaper even.",,,,,,,,
Xj2F0cN0iPBuH17U6fpZaA,1,"Very poor service, said they were too busy to even make us tea or take an order. Walked out unserved, there was only one other table. If you can't both fill a catering order and serve people, lock the door.",,,,,,,,
sxXipjylg_YS57uyPXcsug,1,"I dont even think it deserved a star in the first place. Went just seconds ago and while i was ordering the girl was making jokes and laughing, i had to leave and go to taco bell.. Right next to this awful mcdonalds. She didnt even care when i asked her to take my order. She just ignored me the whole time. 

What a shitty customer service",,,,,,,,
tl2rf9ExvFwndhyvpFiMEQ,2,"Mediocre beers, seriously disappointing food. 

First, the food: Absolutely tasteless, uninspired burgers. Dry ribs that are way more ""dry"" than ""ribs"" and taste like literally nothing. Butter chicken sauce heavy on tomato, with chunks of crusty, pan-fried (not stewed) chicken floating in it. Beer list heavy on the usual corporate imports, completely ignoring the local craft brew industry.

Service was friendly, which is the only reason this place gets two stars and not one.

Once upon a time the Duke was my go-to pub in the neighbourhood. Never again.",,,,,,,,
G_FGZOpF5HgG-yxW79P7PQ,1,"Decided to stop at the Steak  'n Shake on South Blvd after a afternoon of boating on Lake Wylie. The whole reason we stopped is that online it said that they had ""8"" good Vegetarian choices and since we had a Vegetarian with us, we decided to give it a go. We sat in line for around 15 minutes, but it was fine we were looking at the menu online. But Alas when we got to the order microphone we were unhappy to hear that not one of the ""8"" items they mentioned online did they have. They were supposed to have a Veggie Burger and a Vegetarian Melt. Nope....they had Cheese Fries they said, that's  all. So we had no choice but to order the cheese fries, and we ordered a couple of sandwiches. The cheese fries were just the small order of fries with some Cheese Whiz stuff on them, not hot but cool. I ordered a Frisco Burger which was two white pieces of bread with a couple of paper thin patties on them and a sauce that was like a tomato mayonnaise, the amount of grease was intense. The bread was suppose to be sourdough and thick but it was not. My husband got a Portobello and Swiss burger, his was probably the best, but also almost 7 dollars. I realize this is NOT a vegetarian place but usually in todays society with so many people opting out of red meat you would think they would have had an option, like they described online.  I remember when Steak'n Shake first came out it was really good....Not so much anymore!",,,,,,,,
PtX1AIIM0bSJ3fdFppyxRA,2,"The food wasn't that great. You'd see something that looked good, take one bite of it, and let the server take it away. Because the food wasn't satisfying, I kept eating more and more to compensate, which resulted in me feeling nautious for the next hour.

The redeeming parts were the deserts and the free Buffet Liquor (Mimosa, etc.). The deserts were very tasty.",,,,,,,,
1LCpVw3TKDCvWRHwG93QVg,2,"The poke concept is hitting Arizona in waves. 

By no means is this a true Hawaiian style poke, but more of a deconstructed version filled with options such as vegetables, fruit (mango as a protein choice?!?), nacho (what the what?!?), and Asian influenced dressings.

Basically, you follow steps 1-4 and you'll have your shallow tray quickly assembled by the staff. 

Step 1 - Select base and size (small 2 scoops $9, medium 3 scoops $11, large 4 scoops $13)
Step 2 - Select your protein
Step 3 - Select your mix-ins (unlimited, free) and flavor
Step 4 - Select your garnish and sides (unlimited except extra sides and avocado)

On my initial visit, I ordered the medium with brown rice and spring mix, and my choice of 3 scoops of protein (1 tuna, 2 salmon). The staff placed the fish into a stainless steel mixing bowl and added my mix-ins (red\/green onion, jalapeños) and added a package of low sodium soy sauce. With a quick stir, she poured it on top of my green leafy vegetables and cucumbers. I asked to topped it off with masago, shichimi powder and a mini-scoop of the imitation crab meat. 

With my first bite of the tuna, I thought it was passable but the salmon was a little bit more disappointing. The salmon meat did not have a firm texture. In preparing my meal, I noticed the staff had a difficult time scooping it because it seemed excessively wet. 

The prices were slightly inflated compared to other poke places on the West Coast. There were bench and table sitting but majority of the diners took their meals to-go. The ice cream macarons ($3.50) look very appealing but decided to pass. 

My favorites continue to be Poki One N Half (San Diego) and Calipoke (OC) for this type of style, and would consider Poke Bar more like Poke Subpar.",,,,,,,,
7hrtK6_z1URQJkdRESByDQ,1,"Too bad Yelp! doesn't let you give a 0-star.

Decor:
Or lack of.  Trying to match the King St W hipster notion and failed big time.

Cleanliness:
Oh where do I start?  How about the floor.  There were mouse trap and sticky pad visible on the floor and around the benches...I wonder why???  Here is an idea, pay an exterminator.  Our water glasses had stuck-on food ON THE INSIDE, when I asked for a new one, the waiter\/owner didn't seem to care or apologetic.  My steak and rice came with a long curly hair which I was not about to digest after seeing the rest of the restaurant.  How they pass the health inspection is beyond me.

Taste:
Fine dining my a$$, tastes more like straight out of the microwave.  There is no creativity that sets aside the food from other places.  And the fusion part, I was looking around to find that.  I ordered the steak, medium rare.  First of all, it looked more like 2 beef patties out of your local Loblaws slapped together.  Second of all, 2 pieces were rare and 1 piece was well done.  Maybe that was their attempt at FUSION??

Service:
It literately took 10 min to just get the menu and another 15 to get water or even attention at the table.  We bought a Groupon and the server didn't even seem to know what menu we are suppose to pick from.  The Groupon clearly said ANY wine upto $9\/glass but the server INSISTED that it was only the $6 house-wine.  I was in no mood to argue over stupid stuff and only to get a glass of cheap Jackson & Triggs.  WOW!!!

Atmosphere:
Dark, smells like Indian food and BO mixed for too long and dirty.

Respect to those that like the crap they serve here, I don't know how you people stand it but it seems the standards in the area is fairly LOW.  Save your money and go to any over-priced franchise and it'll taste better than this slop.",,,,,,,,
hEcjSZXVh1WMGS75MvfGWg,1,"Truly one of the worst places to eat at in Vegas.
I ate here a while back and it's just plain horrid.
Even old white people won't eat here.",,,,,,,,
JsGASokYzaRrp_yfefxSRQ,2,"I work in the area so have eaten at this location numerous times.

The location is right across from the Mandalay Bay.

The staff at this location changes constantly. But no matter how often the staff changes you can always count on them being inept. 

If you have to eat here I'd suggest walking inside. The drive through is always a long wait.

The food is typical McDonalds except for their french fries. At most McDonalds I love their fries...not at this place. They're always old and it taste as if they never change the oil in their fryer.  I've never had a good french fry at this place.

If you're really craving McDonalds I'd suggest you try another one.",,,,,,,,
R_orapyHb3bGiC5y38oh6w,1,"I would have called the restaurant directly, but Phillips offers no telephone numbers!!!  I contracted food poisoning from the calamari I ate 2 hours ago at the Charlotte airport location.

Es-GsGc4fh0V87wKCuyiAg,2,"Overpriced.  The only reason they get two stars is because they sell cheese cubes which was always nice to add to a packed lunch, but still, it was very expensive for what you get.

How can you call yourself a burger joint when you eff up the patty?!! It was OVERCOOKED, there's a difference between medium cooked and still juicy vs OVERCOOKED and dry af. The same thing happened to 2 of my other coworkers as well so it didn't happen to just me. Not going back!",,,,,,,,
RZqWDWlGqQRXlVujZHbzKw,2,"On a Sunday morning, things got rolling slowly here... took a while to get basic attention, water, staff seemed frantic and recovering from a Saturday night perhaps.  

No egg substitutes here... ""we stick strictly to the menu"" we were told, so if it says poached and you want scrambled, or egg-whites, too damn bad.
Had the crispy spinach and portobello which was good, then learned that the spinach is deep-fried which I wish I'd known before I ordered.

Not kid-friendly so you'll get the staff fish-eye if you've got little ones along.

Overall the food seemed over-priced and the quaint atmosphere only goes so far.  Hop over to Marigold's down the block for the real deal.",,,,,,,,

Food tasted very well. To my dismay, the quantity for biryani and kabobs turned out to be very short despite the fact that the number of guests who showed up were less than the number paid for. This was very embarrassing for me and the only sore point during my daughter's wedding. Bride, groom and the guests at the back of the line didn't get food. I was later told by some friends that they had encountered food shortage at another wedding where food was catered by #Bombaygrille. Unfortunately I found this out too late. I would not recommend them to hire for an important event such as a wedding.",,,,,,,,
nCZ_Iw8pX5XrzM-Ldqfw5Q,2,"I was really disappointed in this Westin Hotel, just off the Strip in Las Vegas. 

You would think that Westin, one of the better brands of hotels in the Starwood family, would go all out for their only Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Top shelf to attract both the business travelers who have learned to rely on Westin's level of service, and the casual traveller, who wants a good hotel near the strip. 

They missed on both.

This Westin can't make up its mind between being a business hotel and a Vegas hotel. It has a very small casino, with 1 crap table, a few table games, and some slots, but virtually nobody playing. The crap table never opened. 

And the rooms are small and very much business like, versus Vegas like in size, decor and style. 

And although Westin has only owned this porperty for less than 6 years, it is already showing age around the edges, losing any freshness or swank it might have had at opening. It just doesn't have a crisp feel like many other Westins in major cities have. 

And right now, the city is doing major construction work on this section of Flamingo Road, so getting in and out of here is a hassle. 

If you want a business hotel in Vegas, I suggest you try Embassy Suites on Paradise. And if you want a more resort like hotel that is reasonable, try the Hilton Grand Vacation properties (there are 3 in Vegas). EIther can be had for under $150. OR get those internet deals from the major Casino Hotels, which are offering some great deals. Like the Venetian mid-week for $69, or many others for under $100.

At least I got 1 day of starpoints to add to my Starwood SPG account.",,,,,,,,
zL6UGkjazbFoJW5TzmlDEg,1,"We have been eating here for years and it seems that the food and the service have steadily gone downhill. Tonight was the last night I will eat at Char Bar7. We're officially breaking up for good this time. 
The last few times the food was barely edible. Tonight, the blue cheese Coleslaw was rancid. My husband and I both had it as a side item. We brought it to the attention of our waiter and he sent the manager over. She proceeded to tell us that the KM (thanks for the jargon) tried it and it was fine. I suggested that if she was familiar with how it was to taste for her to try it. She left pretty hastily and then come back and  said she tried it and the bar back (thanks again) did too and it was fine. She explained it's made with real blue cheese crumbles. Well, maybe so but those crumbles tasted like they had been left out in today's 80 degree weather. 
She offered to take it off our bill. I appreciate that but the food and attitude are enough to make me take my money elsewhere. Eater beware!",,,,,,,,

coryqtuTfvDS6ckr6CvgEA,2,"So disappointed to have to write this!  Our large group of 12 came at around 4:00pm and were able to get 2 tables together pretty quickly, which was great.  Then our waitress was quick to get us started on drinks, again, that was great.  

Then, a waiter came to our table and said he was taking over for our waitress and all the guys were so disappointed.  When I asked what the big deal was, one guy said men don't take care of people like women.  I thought okay, maybe he has a point.

Well, he definitely did have a point.  The waiter was HORRIBLE.  Not attentive, we sat with empty glasses for at least 10 minutes before he noticed, and several times we had to flag him down for more drinks and napkins and our check.  

It was a bummer because the space is great, the beer is great, and the food is great.....but the service ruined our whole experience.",,,,,,,,

#NAME?,2,"Came here for lunch since we're staying in the hotel, and wish I would've just gone across to Chayo (at the Linq).  The chips and salsa were good, the drinks are watered down, the food does not taste fresh (it tastes like re-heated food), and customer service is okay.  The patio is nice, and the music is appreciated but that's about it.  It terms of pricing, I guess it's fine considering it's Vegas.  

Bottom line, if you don't care about the food\/drinks\/customer service, then this is your place.  I'm not coming back!",,,,,,,,
tK_hlz7LrG_mzeBaUuF_4A,2,"I don't know if we went on an off night (I have read other reviews from the night we went that complained about the service as well).  But, to say I was underwhelmed with Bazaar Meat is an understatement.  When we walked in, I was blown away.  It's a dark and very chic looking place.  There is a small casino to your left as you walk in.  I can't believe other restaurants haven't thought of this, it's such a fantastic idea.  I've seen them in clubs, but not restaurants.  Waiting for your table, how about dropping a hundred at roulette?  

The hostesses were very friendly and we were seated right away.  We had drink orders taken very quickly.  So far, so good.  This place is really an assault on the senses.  There are smells from the grilling, the music is loud, there are alligator heads on the wall, and employees everywhere.  The kitchen is very busy, and you can see most of it from the seating area.  Our server started off friendly, and stayed friendly, but he also stayed away from our table.  This is one of the reasons I am giving 2 stars.  As the meal wore on, he was nowhere to be seen.  It took nearly a half hour to get our check.  Also, a table 2 tables from us remained unbussed for over 20 minutes.  I know you are crowded, it's a new hot restaurant on the Strip, but these are issues that shouldn't happened at a place of this caliber charging what they charge.  Most telling, two in my party ordered cocktails when we sat down.  The glasses remained on the table after they were completed, empty, for the entire 2.5 hour meal.  This would have been an easy fix, yet there they remained.  It became kind of a joke with us to see how long they would last.  Spoiler alert:  they were on the table when we left.  For all I know, they still are.

As other yelpers note, the menu is not your typical steakhouse.  It was described to us as a steakhouse meets a tapas place.  I would agree, this is a spot on description.  We started with the Iberico ham, the best ham in the world.  For $70 you don't even get 2 ounces (see my picture), but it's the best HAM IN THE WORLD.  I never regret buying this stuff, and it was no different at Bazaar Meat.  It is served with crustinis with tomato spread on them, sort of a Spanish bruschetta.  The whole thing is fantastic, highly recommended, but it ain't cheap folks.  We next went with the chicken croquettes.  You get 5-6 per order for $12, and they were fantastic.  Fried perfectly and lots of béchamel flavor.  Loved these things, I could have easily eaten another order.  

A couple at our table ordered the famous foie gras cotton candy.  I didn't try it, they ate it so quickly.  I regretted getting one, but we had other things on our mind....

Like the steaks.  Unfortunately, they were out of the Lindsay Ranch ribeye, which of course I'd had my eye on since making the reservation.  As a result, we went with the Mishiwa Reserve, which is $65 a pound.  Supposedly, our steak weighed 2.5 pounds.  Now, I don't carry a scale with me to dinner, but there is no way this thing weighed 40 ounces.  But, we were hungry, and we ate it rather than complaining.  We did point it out to our server, but he said he had no way of knowing since we started eating.  He's absolutely right, but we still weren't happy with the size of this steak.  I don't know, maybe the bone weighs in at 22 ounces or something.  Also, this is the worst dry aged steak I've eaten.  It didn't have the depth of flavor you expect with dry aging.  Additionally, it wasn't adequately seasoned.  This was a fairly big error on such an expensive steak at a restaurant like this.  We ate the steak because we were hungry (and paid an arm and a leg for it), but we weren't happy.

We also tried the quarter of a suckling pig.  Now we're talking!  This thing was as advertised: juicy, flavorful, with that great crispy skin.  We got as much meat off of the thing as we could, but all of us could have used more.  

For sides, we went with the Delmonico potatoes, asparagus, and carrots.  All were good, the potatoes were almost too decadent (if such a state exists).  The asparagus is small, but it was cooked well.  I could have used more flavor from the romesco sauce.  The carrots with pepper and Greek yogurt was probably the table favorite.  I'd absolutely get this dish again.

We were given a small plate of desserts gratis at the end of our meal.  They, like the rest of the meal, were hit and miss.

Overall, I'd say this is an ambitious and unique addition to the fine dining scene in Las Vegas.  I don't know if we went on a bad night (as noted above, I've seen at least one other review that dined the night we did, November 15, 2014, that complained about the service).  I also know restaurants grow and even the best places have issues.  But, for what we paid, a lot of the things are close to inexcusable.  I'd return, but not for a long time, and I will definitely bring a scale....",,,,,,,,

How do you go to NYC and not have a slice of pizza? You dont! You have to do those things to experience how folks there chow down.
 
    So if in Pittsburgh, you throw caution and your diet to the winds and try a Primant Bros sandwich. In town for a Pittsburgh fottball weekend, (Panthers-ND, Steelers- Bills and even Slippery Rock-Seton Hill) our first stop after the hotel is the famous PB, within walking distance and smack dab on the fringe of Pitt's campus.
    
     Over time Ive learned to trust my inner voice. ""Buy this stock, its a great investment"" or ""Marry her, it'll work out"".  Sometimes I go against it, with rationale like ""eat it, you've had worse"", or  ""so what if I'm husband number five?""   Well, sitting down at PB's I had a naggin feeling to get the capicola or the pastrami...Not a naggaing feeling, more of a screaming ""GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!"" vibe going on.. Nice atmosphere, easily navigatable menu,  (""GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!"") a good mix of beers, TV's all around the room.  This is a Pitt landmark, gotta take in the full experience (""GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!"").

      So here's the waiter ,a  fine and friendly fellow and I can hear my mouth and brain arguing. (Mouth: ""Get the number 2, I dont care, I hate this guy anyway from last nights tofu""..  Brain: ""We're paying for this, jerk, get what you really want"") Mouth wins and I order the hamburger patty with the requisite fries, colesalw, tomatoes and thick sliced Italian bread.  The rationale? Its their #2 seller, after beer!

     The food comes and it only take 2 bites to chastise my brain for not taking charge  (""GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!""). The coleslaw makes the fries cold, and the hamburger patty well, I'll be kind.  Imagine taking off your shoe, taking out the inner sole, placing it on the grill for 3 minues, them placing it into a  sandwich...Bland, over done, totally buried by everything else in the sandwich. No amount of ketchup could save it..   (""GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!"")   I probably should have just taken it out and eaten a cole slaw\/fries sandwich...

Of course while I'm eating, (well enduring is more like it) the sandwich, the next table orders the pastrami....It looked deleicious, hearty, tasteful. My one time to eat at PB's and I choose (like the guy in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) poorly. I wont slam Primanti Bros with one star because I had alternatives and only one visit. (Note to Brain: Stand up for yourself!. Dont let the Mouth make all the decisions, he only works here, you're supposed to be running the place!..)   

If in Pittsburgh again, I will try PB's again. And I will get, all togther now:  THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!",,,,,,,,
jLA8qEpHovlotWASCkf4_A,2,"The food is okay and tastes good but nothing great for that price. Even the apps were small and over priced. I came here with a big group of 13 and the service was there but would not come as often, we were done eating for 20 min and our dirty plates were still on the table, i saw the waitress was busy but she ignored 13 of us for most of the service. She tried her best as the manager stood there watching not even lifting a finger.

The Scallion Pancake was the star, though.",,,,,,,,
zGOWVJfQt0JiV09ZuK3bYw,2,"Meh truly is the best rating for my experience at Pasta Brioni. 

I ended up there on the last day of Yelp Eats with a group of friends in a craving for Italian. From what I saw on their menu, I was very excited to see what was i store for me and had heard pretty decent things. I walked out not that excited. 

The ambiance inside is very nice, though a bit on the dark side. The decor inside told a completely different story than what I was thinking when I saw the entrance. It is very posh inside and I did like the comfy booths.

We arrived early enough to get the early bird special, which appeared to be a better deal than the yelp eats one. I wonder if this was truly our best choice. 

For me when it comes to pasta, I am a bit picky. This mainly comes from the fact that I don't like really heavy sauces and I really do not like tomatoes. It has to be a good Italian place and not your run of the mill to get me excited.

My first course was a Caesar salad. Wait take that back. That was supposed to be my first course. I believe I really got romaine lettuce, croutons and dressing of the day. It definitely was *not* Caesar. This left me sad. The bread with it though was pretty damn good although I suggest bigger bottles of balsamic. We ran out fast! 

My main course was chicken marsala and a side of penne. The penne came with a paste (note I did not say sauce) and seemed a little dry and bland. The chicken marsala was actually decent but pretty run of the mill and nothing spectacular. 

Dessert involved two mini cannolis. Like the pasta, they seemed a little dry and lacking, but were flavorful. 

Overall my meal was really just okay. The service was also nothing outstanding either, including someone having to ask for water on several occasions.",,,,,,,,

First time in my life I ever didn't leave a tip. 

I ordered a plain cheese pizza and some pepperoni rolls at 1pm on a Monday. Come on, guys. Inexcusable. I normally try to be fair and not complain but it wouldn't be an honest Yelp review if I didn't point this all out. Sorry. For what it's worth, the pepperoni rolls are really good.

They charged us $7.00 for a bottle of miller lite, I think that's extreme for domestic 12 oz beer. Seems like the waiters and waitresses were confused and were not sure what we order, we ended up not getting two of our dim sum orders. We were told the kitchen recycled our paper where we placed our order...lol. After our first time with poor service, we wanted to give them another chance. We went back a week later and this time the service was even worse. We sat at our table for a good 25 minutes, no one came and asked us if we wanted water or even gave us the menu. We decided to leave the place. Until I hear the service has improved, I will not waste my time and money at this place.",,,,,,,,

8V60t8gGdjEGHG46k28hEg,1,"I'd give no stars if permitted. I may attend other Buffalo Wild Wings but not this location in Goodyear. This isn't the first time I've had bad service at this location, but it was the worst customer service experience I've ever had. In  speaking to others they have also shared their experiences with poor customer service at this location.  I live in Goodyear so it's unfortunate. I had a waitress who first thought it excusable to not wait my table for more than 20 minutes after being seated, then she tried lie by saying she wasn't our waitress, to make maters worse she claimed my husband was cursing at her(which he never even gave a tone like he was using foul language) and the worst part is she continued to harass us by returning to our table after I had requested the manager. I finally decided to walk to the counter to ask for the manager myself she followed me continuing to harass me. The manager wasn't much better.  His Initial response was his response to my email and his response was very nice but I felt he was more concerned with making excuses for his employee. He was checking with the host to see if maybe tables were switched on her or something that could have thrown her off. I don't think that should matter, regardless of the reason, there should be no excuse for that type of behavior. He did apologized and asked if there was anything he could do for us. I was not looking for handouts,  but in my past experience with poor service, the management has never asked me if there is anything they could do for me. Instead they took the initiative to try and make things right. Then I received an email response which stated ""We strive very hard to make orders correct the first time, but we are only human and we sometimes make mistakes."" This was spilled water, that would be a mistake. This was behavior issues. There is so much more I could say but I won't. I will just never return to this restaurant and will tell everyone I know about this experience.

BVddoV8XCJJPwc7mS9EVHg,2,"2.5\/5. 

I went here for the Summerlicious lunch. Upon entering the restaurant, I was impressed at how spacious it was! 

Normally for Summerlicious, I tend to pick the most expensive main course so it will worth the money lol. With that said, this time I chose the ravioli as my main since the steak will probably give me itis after lunch :(.

Overall thought: lunch was okay, but not spectacular. None of the items on their lunch menu jumped out to me as special. Since we had 12 people, there was also a service charge so our bill came to almost $40... which were probably the most expensive lunch I ever had.

-East Coast Seafood Escabeche: 
The seafood was cooked perfectly, and by marinating them in vinegar and olive oil, it gave the seafood a deliciously sharp tang. The watermelon and capers toned down the tanginess of the seafood with theirs sweetness and saltiness flavors, respectively. However, I felt the chili was not needed as the dish turned out to be too spicy. Don't get me wrong, I love spicy food but the heat from the chili lingered in my mouth, and prevented me from tasting other flavors.

-Lemon Basil Ravioli: 
The ravioli had a perfect ratio of fillings to dough, and I believe the filling was ricotta cheese, yum! Unfortunately there were only 2 dots of the lemon basil sauce on the plate, hence I couldn't taste the sauce at all :(. The tomato ragout was just like any other regular tomato pasta sauce that I could have made. Also, I'm not sure why there were a few pieces of candied walnuts as they didn't go well with the savory ravioli at all... 

-Corn meal crusted Halibut: 
Friend loved it but the halibut was overcooked. Moreover, for me anything crusted with cornmeal is pretty much tasteless, so I was expecting the sauce to deliver a big punch of flavor, but I was quite disappointed...

-Strawberry Bavarois: 
I didn't get to try, but my friend seemed to enjoy it. I was quite curious of how the black pepper would go with the bavarois though

-Triple Layered Chocolate Mousse: 
I ordered the mousse and it was not overly sweetened, however it wasn't bad nor awful. The mousse itself had a dense texture and strong chocolate flavor. The first layer was jello or something, I just can't quite put my finger on it but it was good! The top layer was tangy and really helped to cut down the rich chocolate mousse.",,,,,,,,

m17W7ChZ07_-_Br_ASUACA,3,"I actually called ahead to place an order for pickup as one of the other yelpers suggested.
The person(female) who answered the phone kept responding YES, SURE, YES. Which I thought was a bit weird, maybe they were just busy.
The only thing is when I got there, only one customer was in the store sitting down eating her soup of the day, which she was raving about (Manish Water). Apparently they have a different soup daily. and my food was not prepared and I came 15mins or so after I called which is plenty of time to scoop food into a container -_-
Customer Service is there but don't expect conversations or anything more than your total .. I mean your paying less than 20 bucks for take out, this isn't some dine in restaurant where you are waited on. 
The restaurant is located off of King street, when you turn onto king street from Hurontario you will actually drive past the doors w 3 lil steps up.. you can barely see the sign but it is right beside a Hakka Chinese food place also with the name Freddy.turn into the first lot and walk back onto King st for the front door.
So I ordered a small oxtail (16$) and a lunch special fried chicken (8$), when I got there like I said my food wasn't prepared and I saw the price list 2$ more for a large oxtail so I told her just give me the large (not much difference only bigger container). I did find it a bit pricey I mean 18$, i don't know. 
The fried chicken was def worth the 8$, the chicken has a slight redish coating which I've never seen before not sure what they use that gives it that colour but tasted amazing and fresh. The oxtail on the other hand was quite rubbery and lots of fat. however the flavor was amazing , glad I got lots of gravy on my rice. Love that they do it with the butter beans (white lima beans), adds extra flavor. As i said it did all taste great but for the price\/portion size\/ fat-meat ratio I wouldn't spend 18$ . Maybe be back for the friend chicken and to try a soup special.

EEbNOUx0IYm6c1Ikh9R5jA,3,"I came here with a friend because I thought it was pretty ""ballsy"" for a place to serve mainly fried chicken. The atmosphere screams hipster all the way down to the cutesy menu, but the decor is nice and it is clean.  The servers are also straight out of Bucktown\/Wicker Park (you pick) along with their attitudes, tattoos, piercings and beards. The server was attentively inattentive.  She checked on us at least 4 times once dinner was served, but not once refilled the water. 

The crab hushpuppies were delightful and I would likely order again. The fried chicken left much to be desired.  I understand that I ordered the ""light"" and white meat tends to be on the dryer side, but the breast was dry.  The breading seems to need a bit more seasoning and is possibly very good when fresh out of the frier.  However, I felt that my chicken may have sat in the back for a minute or under a heat lamp before arriving to the table.  Sweet potatoes were very good and my friend appeared to enjoy her chicken tacos. 

I would probably give their chicken one more chance before writing them off completely. 

Long story short, if they are priding themselves on fried chicken, I've had better.",,,,,,,,

The food was tasty and we had a good time. The issue was with the time it took to get food. I am patient when a place is busy, but this was far past acceptable. Our bartender and the manager were both attentive and took care of us while we waited. That is why they get three stars instead of one or two.

The first thing I tried was the Asadero Hash Brown. They are great. The textures and flavors are spot on. These are a very good side for any meal.

Next up were the Buffalo Chicken Sliders. These are exactly like they sound. No need for further description. The buns, meat and sauce are good. These  are a nice appetizer.

The last thing I tried was the Sticky Belly Steamed Buns. These are steamed buns filled with pork belly, Asian peanut slaw and green onion. They normally come with cilantro as well, but I hate cilantro so requested them without it.

OeLCkHI74Kx0xIVKXPfsxQ,3,"This large AYCE place is sort of like Todai meets PF Chang's. 

It is located in the Place Longueuil shopping mall on the South Shore off St. Laurent, not too far from the Pont Jacques-Cartier. 

Todai is known in California for it's all you can eat sushi in mass quantities, buffet style. PF Chang's, that Scottsdale, AZ HQ'd Chinese chain, is known for its large faux statues. Sushi Palace combines these. 

The place is very large, seating over 100 people, maybe up to 200 if you used every seat. The space has high ceilings and is airy, with large columns covered with ancient Chinese calligraphy, and above the sushi counter and kitchen, large Buddha statues on the upper half of the wall. These are not Japanese looking Buddhas, but skinnier Chinese looking ones. Nonetheless, they add to the PF Chang likeness of the massive horses they use in front of those faux Chinese eateries. 

And speaking of faux, this is faux Japanese, as it is owned and staffed with Chinese. And although it is an AYCE place, it is not a buffet. You sit, get a waiter, order off little sushi or other item check lists, and they go order it for you from the cooks\/chefs under the Buddhas. 

They do have a large selection and variety of foods. They carry most common Nigiri sushi items (except Uni and other more exotics), and some sashimi as well. And they offer other popular Japanese dishes like Yakitori au Boeuf and Tempura aux Crevettes. Actually, they have 5 different Yakitoris and Tempura selections. 

But if you feel like mixing your Japanese with Chinese, try the Poisson Szechuannais ou L'agneau Mongolien. Thinking about noodles? They have Pad Thai au Poulet ou Boeuf, ou Udon.  They even have on Vendredis et Samedis la Cuisine Chaude, ""Boulettes de Pieuvre"" ou Takoyaki! And being in Quebec, they offer Escargots Gratines. Oh, and if you want a little flavor of Korea, order the Kimchi! No Poutine, though!

The service was actually pretty friendly and efficient, and the food wasn't bad for an AYCE place. Dinner is $25.50, and you fill out your 2 tickets, and when you are ready, fill 2 more out till you're full. 

If you feel like Asian food but want a variety and you are really hungry, this place is meant for you. Bon Appetit!",,,,,,,,
3ENjUVuJNY4hHRL9GgKGBQ,3,"I have been to the Mars at Yonge and Eglinton many years ago for brunch, but this was my first time at the location - supposedly the original Mars. 

This is your classic greasy spoon diner and certainly looks the part. However, it does not have the dirty \/ grimy feel that you may typically associate with a diner. It has bar seating along the left side where you can clearly see the cooks preparing your meal fresh to order and there are tables along the right hand side with a few booths at the back.

I arrived around 11:45, and while the restaurant was not packed, it was certainly busy and I was told to seat myself. 

The menu is quite broad with all of your typical greasy spoon \/ diner options, and they seem quite willing to accommodate any special requests. I like that you can ask for pretty much anything on the side, for example a single pancake or a single slice of French toast - no problem!

I ordered a fresh fruit plate with a side of rye toast and my friend ordered a more typical diner meal of eggs over easy with home fries, toast, bacon, and an order of French toast on the side. The fresh fruit plate consisted of a sliced banana, a few orange slices, a chopped gala apple, and some grapes. The grapes weren't the freshest, but I was still satisfied.

Service was fairly bare because there was only one waitress serving the entire place, but she was very pleasant and was happy to answer any questions we had. They forgot to give my friend maple syrup for his French toast, and when we asked for it she apologized and brought it right away.

My visitor had one of the sandwiches with chips and found it perfect.

1byHZUlCZyx4EwMer09_yQ,3,"This place was hit or miss.  When it was on, it was on, but the misses were significant.  My buddy and I ate here for lunch upon arriving into town on a Thursday afternoon.  There were only 2 other tables with diners, so we were immediately seated.  After ordering our drinks, we perused the menu.  It was an Oyster Bar, so I was expecting some New Orleans beers like Abita or Blackened Voodoo Lager.  No dice, it was all pretty basic stuff.  They have a full bar, so we had cocktails.  Our server was attentive but not overbearing.  No complaints there.

I went with the New England (the only kind) clam chowder and the parmesan crusted halibut.  The soup was good, it had nice big chunks of clam and potatoes.  It needed pepper and Tabasco, but I have found that most clam chowders are on the bland side, so this wasn't a surprise.  I'd order this again.  Likewise, my fish was cooked really well.  It was flaky and not overdone, and the parmesan crust was tasty, but I could have used more.  It was in a cream sauce that was BEGGING for seasoning.  This was superfluous, all it did was make the dish wet.  But, the spinach on the side was seasoned very well.  One of the better spinach dishes I can remember having.  If I were to order this again, I would ask for no sauce.

My buddy ordered the blackened scallops in a Cajun cream sauce over pasta.  When it arrived, I was jealous.  It looked FANTASTIC.  I immediately regretted my order.  But, when he tasted it, there was no flavor to the cream.  It was colored as though it had lots of pepper in it, but it was only cream.  It was actually impressive how something that looked so good could taste so bland.  So, he picked out the scallops and ate them.  The server noticed he didn't eat the pasta and asked him why.  When he told the server the issue, the server offered him another entrée.  My buddy declined, so the server got him a gratis cocktail.  I think the dish should have been taken off the bill entirely, but at least he made some gesture.  I'd eat here again, but absolutely wouldn't order that ""Cajun"" pasta.",,,,,,,,
