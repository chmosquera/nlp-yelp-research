3-0gjJ1KU8R9fnqSKk8bHg,5,"Wowwww.  Okay, so - five star rating, not easy to get from me.  But this place HAS to be on my top ten favorite restaurants in Vegas as of this moment.  Their hummus is out of this WORLD.  I actually liked it more than the wrap that I had (which was definitely tasty!).  Seriously.  You have to go and try it for yourself.  It's a hidden gem.  You can easily miss it, even looking for it, as my date and I did.  The service is also good.  The people who work there are really nice, so that's of course part of the five star rating.  It's Mediterranean, so it might go without saying that there are vegetarian options aplenty, but I won't let it go unsaid.  Please, just do yourself a favor.  Go here and try it out yourself.  If you're a hummus lover, as I am, your life is not complete without trying the hummus HERE.  (You can thank me later.)  ; )",,,,,,,,
N3oHuGScFrcGVwptY_hdew,5,"Pizza by the slice. I love this place. Very casual, order at the counter, people-watch on the patio in downtown BC. $2.55 for a slice of pepperoni. I've eaten here since '97. My favorite pizza in southern Nevada.",,,,,,,,
tCTVRRSME2eHJk146ZwqDg,5,"This is in the top 5 meals I have ever had, maybe even in the top 3. Yes, it was that good! This is a really small restaurant with 5 tables and bar seats. I have had cajun, New Orleans style food once, in New Orleans, about 10 years ago so I really didn't know what to expect since it had been so long and I didn't even remember what I ordered. The server suggested and appetizer and 1 meal for 2 people to split and it was perfect, just enough food. We started with shrimp in a garlic broth. I wanted to pick up the bowl and drink the broth it was so good!. Two pieces of bread soaked in the broth later, and lots of shrimp, our crawfish and crap ettouffee came out. It was so full of flavor and a very large portion. It was packed with plenty of crawfish and crab. 

Luckily our server explained the heat ratings to us because he said it was 1-10 and I immediately said we want 6. Well, their 6 is not what I was thinking because he said a 3 is tabasco sauce! We went with 3 on both dishes and it had just the right amount of heat. 

This is a really good restaurant and I can't wait to go back. It is worth every penny and the wait.",,,,,,,,
CL2VbmE16Tmh1TZl89WlTw,5,I love this place and the vegan option is beyond scrumptious. Thank you for having it on the menu. I crave it when I'm out of town!,,,,,,,,
qbCmqTdk6_bso0F8h1RBkA,4,"was there for brunch and loved it
all 3 of my friends meals were perfect and we loved the atmosphere and decor
very very good",,,,,,,,
detAL1eBvq6X8coI2LWJaA,5,"Consistently good, The Coffee Cup never disappoints.  Every time we go I get a Bloody Mary and one of their freshly baked cinnamon rolls.  The biscuits and country gravy are amazing as are the hash browns.  The staff here is friendly and the couple who own the place are always there.  I love the surf decor and the homage they give to the Armed Services.  Well worth the traffic if you are visiting, eat a great meal and go see the Damn!",,,,,,,,
oIkcom_kQghyddZsp8iRPQ,5,"I visited this Olive Garden in February 2015. Yes, that was over a year ago. I never took the time to write a review and wanted to do so now.

Our waitress was a black woman named Sandra. (I do not at all mean this in a racist way. I just want to make sure the right Sandra gets credit if theres another employee named Sandra) Sandra was AMAZING. She has a very bubbly fun personality, while keeping it professional at the same time. She was pretty busy that day when we went for lunch, but managed all her tables fine! 

The food was good. Definitely worth what you're paying. I had the chicken parmesan and the chicken was very moist, unlike some other places. 

Anyways, Sandra is pretty much the highlight of this review since Olive Garden has consistent food. LOL. It's been over a year and when I dine out, other restaurant workers cant compete with Sandra!",,,,,,,,

ekXlirOTNWwlQNUopwjK4Q,5,"I have been to Flipside several times in the past couple of years and it just seems to get better every time I go. After reading some of the older reviews, I felt compelled to chime in.

The bowling lanes are the best in town and very well maintained. I always have a great time playing laser tag with my college-age son and he loves it too. The arcade has got some great new games that I haven't seen anyplace else in town.

I have always loved their pizza but I have been pleasantly surprised at how good everything else I have tried is. I know they had a rough start with the food but it seems like they've got it right now. I have never been disappointed with anything I have ordered.

I have really noticed improvement in the lounge. They have a good beer selection and a much cooler crowd then in the past. I think word must be getting around, I hear they didn't serve alcohol when they first opened but they do now. The karaoke on Fridays is pretty fun to watch, though I am not really a singer.

I see a lot of people bagging on the service in other reviews but I've always found it to be top notch. Any issues I have had, the staff has worked hard to make it right. Overall, I really like coming to flipside and I find it a great place to hang out with my friends when we are looking for something to do.",,,,,,,,
VwFKijal4TBw45An4xZHKA,5,"One of the best sandwiches this fat guy has had in Vegas. I ordered a skinny dip, it's like a cheesesteak and a French dip and it was awesome. I really appreciated the bread that it came on, so many sub places have crappy bread. I was really intrigued by the meat styx and will have to come back again.",,,,,,,,
Rd-FS7Oo5TsG68z4olc97Q,5,"best burger in phx! fries are great! fry sauce is yummy! if you want a huge big juicy burger then just go and get the double!! it does not get much better then this, if you get it to go the bottom bum will be gone just about lol",,,,,,,,
vBIAMrxbRHfRuXzDfHpyMA,5,"I've been shish kabobed into this place .. amazing flavors, something new to me and the charcoal grill on the meats is awesome :)",,,,,,,,
6lhDGbt828Jk_UE3SUfl_A,4,More chat options. But little costly. They take descent waiting time. Quality is not bad compared to other restaurants nearby. Liked it.,,,,,,,,
UAxfedO-ATX4WVg-yEemag,4,"I sort of want to give this place 3-1\/2 stars, but oh well. 

This weird little nook, way down on Sheppard, is barely noticeable if you drive by. I've gotten their take out a few times and also eaten in once. 

I've had their chicken shwarma and falafel pitas and sampled some other dishes. Generally, I find the portions quite large and the food quite good, but it's a bit of a crap shoot with the chicken shwarma. I've had it a couple of times where it has been very good and another time I thought the meat was chewy, fatty and full of gristle. It's being cut off of a big hunk on a spit, so I guess you get whatever comes off at that time. 

The service has always been great and very pleasant.",,,,,,,,
lnl4bvuUzAq6NWVZYXQaqg,4,"Honestly, I know this place does not have the best ratings, but I love it here.  The food & drinks NEVER disappoint.  Customer service on the other hand is lacking.  We've been here for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and the street tacos and we haven't had a bad experience.  The food is very tasty and fresh.  I've had several items on their menu, and I don't have any complains.  The drinks are also very good; especially if you like tequila (duh!).  

They need to work on their customer service, though.  The hostesses are nice and very helpful, but the waitresses\/waiters we've had are terrible.  They rarely smile, they always look stressed, and fail to check up on you and at least ask if we need anything else, or how about ""how's everything?"".  Just this last time I was there (Sunday), it took them over 10 minutes to acknowledge us!  That's the only disappointing part about this place.",,,,,,,,
zhtUv6HYm78Ledj9_lzQQw,5,"I got the chicken burger and my girl friend got the bacon cheeseburger. Originally we ordered a combo with the burgers but we cancelled one of the combos later finding out they didn't take credit. So he let us pay some in cash and some in debit. But even tho we paid the price of one chicken burger combo and a bacon cheeseburger alone, he still gave us the fries and drink so the customer service was fantastic. Now for the food.... ONE of the BEST burgers I've ever had. The chicken patty was super crispy but still juicy on the inside and the vegetables were fresh. The fries were clearly fresh by the way it looked after being fried. Definitely recommend this place",,,,,,,,
db7o84kYOGWAPInw4Z8vbA,4,"I struggled deciding between three and four stars with Giada. The food is solid, the decor and views are great, but it is a reach at the price point. We were sat right on time with our reservation. They gave us a nice seat next to the windows looking over the strip. You get good views from nearly every seat to be fair.

The service was pretty good through out. The wine list is extensive, but fairly expensive. They do have some moderately priced by the glass, but not much by the bottle. That is ok, just be prepared.

For my meal I ordered the Veal Chop Saltimbocca, milanese style. It was a large slab of on the bone-in veal chop. It was tasty. The combination of flavors and textures come together nicely. I was happy with my selection.

We chose a few sides for the table. I only tried the Sweet Corn & Sausage with chili oil & mascarpone. It was a unique take on the standard corn side. The flavors are bold and great. Everyone was happy with this choice.

Overall this place is well worth a visit. They decor and views are on point. The food is good. I just feel like it is a touch expensive for what you get. That being said, if friends wanted to try it I would go again.",,,,,,,,
4BNDTxOd0ckca5HNjPU69w,5,"It's always a treat to go to Wrigley's for their Champagne Sunday Brunch! The views are amazing and the beautiful weather yesterday definitely topped it off. The food is always great (I never know where to start, and always eat way too much). The staff, including everyone from valet to our server, were very pleasant, helpful and seemed genuinely happy to be there.  Our server, I think her name was Elaine, was on point and made it a great dining experience.   Hard to pick, but my favorite was probably the salmon, and mimosas of course! I can't wait till the next time!  Also has great photo ops, the grounds are beautiful.",,,,,,,,
ZEReVMPA52LsSXDGZPUOFQ,4,"Small place. Fast and good service. I enjoyed the Kamikaze roll the most. Liked the Orion, Lemon, Spicy tuna rolls. I had some cajun albacore and salmon nigiri as well as a seaweed salad. All were made well and were tasty. I hear this joint is open late. I am sure I will be back as well.",,,,,,,,
#NAME?,5,This place is delicious. The veggies and herbs the bring are always fresh. The pho is amazing and the staff are always super nice. and OMG the shaved snow...its heaven. This is our go to Pho shop and will continue to be. Keep up the good work!!,,,,,,,,

8oFUMhJ7fR2-X3We9TiK7g,4,"I've been here a few times over the years. I'd probably eat here more if I didn't live on the opposite side of town.

I've always enjoyed my experience here and look forward to eating there again.",,,,,,,,
wqbhHjpV2Ax1R9F7azdd7w,4,"My favourites are the cheesecake (both vanilla and chocolate are great), plus the date squares. I gotta try one of their cookie sandwiches one day. Didn't care much for the raspberry crumble (dry & bland with not much fruit, IMHO).",,,,,,,,
C_0PxhyXRmo1V4Q2cmxLFA,4,"We come here pretty frequently for breakfast.  Delicious goodness.  If you get a meal that comes with a muffin, it's a LOT of food.  Enough to share.  Our favorite, chocolate mousse muffin.  Deeee-lish!",,,,,,,,
CFsPROIZALqtIkFAg-d5mA,5,"This place is my Cheers.  I go in there with the same people all the time and when we walk in the staff greets us with a smile and knows our names and they know what my favorite drink is (whiskey on the rocks).  I don't know what this says about my friends and I and our drinking habits, but it says a lot for the staff.  They make you feel welcome and you feel like part of the Pranksters family.  The drinks are strong and pretty cheap, and they have one of the best reubens around in my opinion.  And the onion rings are killer too.  If you want a bar where you can go to just feel comfortable and have a nice conversation with some friends, or meet some interesting and friendly new people, this is the place.  If you are saying ""fuck it...I just wanna dance!"" then go somewhere else.",,,,,,,,
OVXOr0jE_GYmYM1YMoHhOQ,5,Really great restaurant.  Went alone and sat at the bar.  Excellent service. Engaging staff and fabulous food.,,,,,,,,
JzDxlIUfps-U7JiaPepj9g,5,"One of the best burgers I've ever had.  No frills or gimmicks.  Just a simple bun, meat, and cheese burger with some spread & lettuce. High quality ingredients will beat out gimmicks for me anyday.  Or maybe i was just experiencing euphoria from their Salted Dulce de Leche shake which is an absolute delight.  

The short rib taco is also a quality offering if youre not feeling like a burger.  And I still need to go back when their Street Corn is back in season.  

The Stand is a Great place.",,,,,,,,
_-W-pVNX-1FU0HtEzZ2UDg,4,"People should ignore the negative reviews on Ground Control. The west valley really needed a modern midrange restaurant that serves good food. Ground Control has a bit of a Ling & Louie's vibe, if you're familiar with them.

The service was good and so was the price. It seems to me that Ground Control established itself somewhat while at the Verrado, and should hopefully integrate easily into this location.",,,,,,,,
VHYc0YEQME8qkjHVBBud_w,5,Was so inspired after meeting the owners and learning about Even Stevens great philanthropic work that my sister and I had to try the sandwiches. Stopped by and was not disappointed! Phenomenal meals and service. Thank you!,,,,,,,,
Vt8c8cQU3fDfSDBk2EiGgw,4,"Auld Dubliner is one of the reasons I wish more people would go to Lake Las Vegas.  It's a typical Irish bar, mostly wooden, smaller tables, but you actually have some room.  It's not crammed together.  We've only been inside, but they have patio seating as well when the weather is nice.

They have an above average selection for beers, with the usual emphasis on Irish and British beers.  I got a flight of testers that was a decent price, given the quality of beers.  The food was above average as well.  Very large serving of fish and chips.  Good batter, but not too thick.  We got chicken fingers (for our 2 year old), and the table liked these as well.  

Service was excellent.  Drinks never reached empty before she was there asking if we wanted another.  There seemed to be several regulars as well, which is rarely a bad sign.  Overall, above average experience, which is saying something, given the number of Irish pubs that have opened in the last few years.  Worth your time.",,,,,,,,
nc6rY5tg4HajdTeu7697XQ,4,"Obviously you can't be expecting anything crazy authentic from this fast food\/catering south Asian food joint. As such, you don't come here for a luxurious Indian cuisine; you come here because it's fast, available, and satisfying. Thus, Babu deserves 4\/5 stars if that's what you're looking for. 

Babu does its job; everything is cheap, big potions, and delicious (though again, I can't say it's authentic). I like to get their all-day lunch specials which comes with a choice of meat and choice of 3 veggies. For the veggies, their pickled eggplant is a MUST! It's sweet and sour and really adds to whatever you're eating. I also get their veggie special which comes with 5 veggie sides (7 sides on fridays) and rice or roti; also very filling. I like their veggie sides more than their meat sides anyway; the butter chicken is not as good as it used to be but again....good enough for what you give. Their masala dosa is great too, samosas are satisfying, and their desserts are quite delicious, though more expensive than I'd like (desserts are paid by weight).

I frequent this place because it satisfies my Indian food\/south Asian food cravings, it's super affordable, and it satisfies.",,,,,,,,
v5jmftNqGLg8DsskdHkOsQ,5,"By far the best Ramen in town. Good variety - great fried rice that's not too greasy. Rich broth, not too greasy or salty. Gyoza rocks. Tried a number of ramen houses and nothing beats Sora!",,,,,,,,

Now the food, first the bread I'm not a big bread eater but let's just say I kept ordering more. The food i had the Stuffed Tilapia with fresh season vegetables and a side of Truffle Macaroni and Cheese, my husband had the special which was the Salmon with Blue Cheese and Sauted Spinach Im once again not a salmon person I love seafood but not all,and his salmon looked so good. He enjoyed every bite. The price wasnt bad at all for the 2 of us , we walked out saying WE'LL BE BACK.",,,,,,,,
TZcaXfLqobidR_ccIIj6aQ,5,I seriously LOVE finding amazing mom n pop spots! Hot fresh brewed tea that tastes amazing on a breezy evening at a cute tea shop with great music softly playing in the background is soooo good in my soul.  The man friend also loved the breakfast sandwich! I could be here for hours! Definitely coming back soon!!!,,,,,,,,
Zki5iyi0sYXYrxxamUnUoQ,5,"I fell in love with this place when I was working in a Vegas show in 2012. I live in Los Angeles and I visit Las Vegas quite often. There wasn't a single Vegas trip that I didn't stop by Kaizen to have my favorite sushi. I've been to hundreds of sushi restaurants including LA's top rated and most expensive - no one can compete with the taste of food like at Kaizen.
My favorite is a chicken teriyaki bowl and garlic edamame. My spouse loves the avocado train , Palm Springs, orange blossom rolls and pretty much everything else that's on the menu. 
Top sushi restaurants with an amazing environment and music !!!
I'm definitely signing my name under it.

Si3zA55fTNSySD17oeeXqg,4,"De. Lish. Us. 

Delux was one of the first restaurants I went to upon moving to Phoenix and I have gone back a few times since, mainly at lunch during the work week. It's my favorite burger spot. 

The atmosphere is slightly on the pretentious side. However, it's very small and pretty cramped. Even at lunch during the week it can feel cramped at a table and there's a big chance of waiting in line awhile. I've sat both inside and outside and felt a little too close to the other tables. It's a little complicated with bigger groups also.

The food however is amazing. I always get the same thing, a delux burger and sweet potato fries. I don't care if you are scared of medium rare, you need to try this thing. It's one of the most amazing burger's I've had and I can never finish the entire thing. I'd love to have a mini one. That would be perfect. A regular order of fries comes in an adorable metal mini shopping cart. Also good to note is that by default you do not get just ketchup with your fries. Being a non tomato eater, it's nice to not have to remember to ask for another dipping sauce. 

Oh the beer list you ask? Phenomenal. Being able to order a red velvet always makes me happy. Unique beer flights make me happy also. 

I never have room for dessert while I'm there but I did have a friend order the cookies they brag about one time. It was rather hard and I wasn't impressed. That cookie should have been soft and chewy and full of deliciousness.

It's a bit on the pricey side, and you typically are going to have to wait awhile and\/or be cramped, but if you're not in a hurry, it's worth checking out.",,,,,,,,
OLc5RR4qTtlvXch9C2U1vg,5,"We absolutely love this place. Its traditional diner food, so don't expect anything flashy. But the pancakes are huge and always melt in your mouth- I especially recommend the strawberry pancakes. Delicious! Lunch options are also good- standard diner food but I've never been disappointed. Haven't had dinner here. It is one of our go-to breakfast spots when we're looking for comfort food!",,,,,,,,
A5dRFrvnmXQGefumkQ9TAg,5,"Great service first of all. I love Green valley ranch casino. After midnight I hit up the grand cafe for the $6 steak dinner with my bros.  if I'm hungry earlier i hit pizza rock because they have a sick mofo happy hour menu. I always get the calamari with the spicy mayo thing and smother it on my personal pizzas. 

The servers are great and always talk with us. A couple folks that work there are aspiring chefs with big dreams and I hope they get there with work ethics like theirs.",,,,,,,,
z_n8SNgMxgMRmUH9rLTdbw,4,"I held true to my word and tried lunch here shortly after trying breakfast. I walked out with a texan to go and was completely happy and satisfied the rest of the day. And I came back the next weekend, and had the same thing again.

I still wish they had better hours so I could enjoy them some evening after work when I didn't feel like cooking, but no matter what the hours, when they combine their cheese with their stuff, it's a total win.",,,,,,,,
XS3wuIGxFvNdLxpjrkKEeA,4,"Something different!

So I had seen a truck driving around town that had CJ custard on it and wasn't really sure what I was looking at. So I did some yelping slash googling around and found the store.

So I've tried yoghurt, ice cream and slushie kinda drinks and snacks, so frozen custard was a nice little change.

I grabbed a chocolate custard and lime ice for my first go around, as was the recommendation from the gentleman working there. Hey guess what it was tasty as hell!!!

I for sure will becoming back here, service was great with a nice product.
They also cater which maybe something that will be in my future",,,,,,,,

1lwYuzf_EarDGgeohLqyVA,5,"Went here for the first time, I have to say I was impressed. They have a conveyor belt, but it mostly just brings dessert and ginger. The sushi is fresh and they have many creative types of sushi (there was one that was wrapped in cucumber which was amazing). The salt and pepper shrimp was fantastic, along with the pepper beef and tempuras. The service was also very good, the food came quickly and the waitress came to check on us every 5 minutes. 

Definitely coming back to this place",,,,,,,,
8v0LXLP05HLQLMgh5DOQIQ,4,This place changed owners a couple of times since my last review and even though it's okay for take out now & then it isn't as good as it was originally. Tiger roll and bonsai roll are still staples. Always friendly service.,,,,,,,,
j-WxzsE4pdjgyrGkp2pIlg,4,"We showed up for dinner around 6pm on a Wednesday night and we were the only people in the restaurant. I usually would turn around and leave anywhere else, but there are not that many Lebanese restaurants in Vegas, so I decided to give it a go.

Apps:
It was happy hour between 4 and 7, so most of the apps were 1\/2 off. We ordered fattoush, tabouli, hummus, baba ganoush, meat grape leaves, and veggie grape leaves.  Everything was pretty good except the tabouli had too much dressing and could have been mixed with some more bulgar wheat. The fattoush was pretty good and it had enough sumac in it too. Some people don't put enough sumac in their fattoush.

Iced Tea - I think they put rose water in their tea. It was pretty good.

Entrees:
 Chicken shawarma plate. It came with hummus and real Lebanese style garlic sauce. The chicken was not cooked on the proper vertical rotisserie, but it was spiced properly and it tasted very good.

Lamb Kabob - my daughter ordered it well done, so she basically ruined the meat, so I didn't bother to try it. It was a nice presentation though with the rice and veggies.

Falafel plate - they were good. Served with the traditional tahini sauce.

The service was great. It should be, we were the only customers there. The dining room decor reminded me of the Arabic restaurants back home in Dearborn from the 80's. I liked it. Some might find it a bit dated though. I don't know why it was not busy, but I recommend you stop by and try some Lebanese cuisine. I think you will enjoy Ali BaBa's.",,,,,,,,
fZR7BWApqmgbJPrxfDgJ4w,5,"YOJIË IN LAS VEGAS!!! wishes do come true!  Anytime I went to Los Angeles I absolutely had to had to had to make a stop at this restaurant.  Before this restaurant I couldn't bare to eat at any shabu spot in the entire city of Las Vegas, they are all terrible.  

This restaurant is quite a distance from my home but I am happy to make the drive to satisfy my shabu craving!  THIS RESTAURANT IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST!  so much so, that despite the wait for my food that I sometimes experience here they still receive five stars from me!

Yojiës cut
Geisha
Half sukiyaki
Half tonkotsu

How I eat it?
Extra garlic and raddish in the sukiyaki

0pUDNDr6AoQk4dZ7fvkZMw,5,"We had a early dinner here today (our second visit) and I had the MVPita Pocket! It's was so good!! It had lettuce, tomato and sautéed onions with Gyro meat and Kefta which is ground beef, onion and parsley made into patties and sprinkled with feta cheese. You also get a side of tzatziki sauce with it. 
For dessert I shared the Kinafa with my husband, which I found out is a Lebanese dessert. Made with a light pastry crust, ricotta cheese and pistachios sprinkled on top. Nice and light. I would order it all again. 
When I go back I want to try the Dolmas and Lentil soup.

PpGcvRckWoTzNwQE79WxWg,3,"I guess they were okay for a CHAIN, in a MALL.  Service was quick and even gave us free endame, I know, that's not much but it's something.  Just had a few rolls all of which were fine.  3 of the 4 rolls were about the size as a coffee cup, way too big for a humans mouth.  So what's a person do with rolls that are too big?

Do you: 

A) Push the entire roll in you pie-hole and hope no food falls out when you start chewing.
B) Cut up the roll with a knife and fork.
C) Use your chopsticks to pick apart the roll into small bite size portions.

Have your answer ready before you visit this place.",,,,,,,,
hLMxL3EX32CBTm4UhMCXtQ,3,"I read that it was a must see bar in the area and after some confusing directions from Google we found the unmarked black door.  You had to find your own seat and after a minute or so we found three chairs facing a glass wall with a curtain behind it.  The menu had a good but somewhat pricey selection of  drinks, but it was dark enough to not really be able to read the menu. We were told to turn down the light on our cell and my friend noticed an odd smell, and quickly decided it was not our night and left before ordering.",,,,,,,,
31wPhfrGMY-JLDwoxtrTVQ,3,"This is a good place to watch a game and eat.  There is a lot of outdoor seating which is a big plus.  There are many televisions.

Our server was friendly and attentive.

We started with the homemade chips and dip.  The chips were crisp and tasty.   The bacon and blue cheese add a nice touch and pair nicely with the dip.

For my meal I chose the boneless wings in their honey gold sauce.  It is a large portion.  The wings are solid.  The honey gold has good flavor.",,,,,,,,
CWVIyxtVOFDNcStyPk8PSQ,3,"When my date and I came here, it was busy, but we didn't have to wait for a table.  Our server didn't visit us often, but she was very nice.  The veggie burger that I had was good.  Not extraordinary, but I'd come back here again.  I enjoy bowling here at the Orleans, so it's a good possibility!",,,,,,,,
UGCM2-_1EjnjC0ml756T0g,3,"I have mixed feelings about this place. I have eaten inside and have done delivery. My experience with delivery was great! My Philly roll was even served on ice to stay cold! I also ordered the honey chicken, which was recommended from many Yelp reviewers and for me it was too sweet and soggy;  I would not order again. I came back a few weeks later with a friend and ate inside. The place was not busy yet we had to wait for a table, then were seated at a small table that had rips along the seats. This isn't a deal breaker but certainly didn't leave a good first impression. Service was slow, our waiter was very quiet and hard to understand. We ordered 3 rolls (the Gilbert roll, the Vegas Roll and the Philly Roll). The Gilbert roll was outstanding!! I have never had sweet potato inside a roll but it was sooo yummy!! The rest were so-so, nothing great. I did like the fact it's always happy hour so prices were very reasonable! They also do an all you can eat, which I found out after I had already ordered, darn it! I will come back because of the prices and the fact it is so close to my house. Is it the best sushi, no. But it's A-OK!",,,,,,,,
1vNU_TwadDFk-w4iMfdfbw,3,"I am trying not to let the bad press or a friend's huge fan love sway my review. Therefore, this breakfast joint is middle of the road. When a friend first mentioned heading here for lunch, I was curious, and after reading reviews. I was scared. But I trust said friend, and allowed myself to be led in blindly to another Two Hippies joint. 

Here are items that were factored into this 3-star rating:

** First and foremost, I didn't love it, but I most certainly didn't hate it either. If someone wanted to go back, I would agree. There are a few more things on the menu that intrigue me enough to want to try them.

** I didn't like the decor as much as their pizza joint. It was too much on the stoner side of hippie.. to a nauseating degree. Then there was this random old stove that didn't scream hippie at all. I personally prefer happy hippie. Oooh now there's an awesome alliteration. And another. BAM!

** The green chile burger I got was pretty damn good. I wish the heat was kicked up a few notches, but it was solid. I was so pleased I nearly swallowed that thing whole.

** They have the lemonade I love. I tried mango this time. Not as good as blood orange, but still solid.

** I did not find the breakfast menu so appealing I wanted it instead of lunch. This was a disappointment. I also heard they don't serve breakfast all day, though one of the people I was dining with did get breakfast. I think we were there around 1pm if I remember correctly.

** The fries were terrible. I love crinkle fries but these were so dry I was unable to enjoy them. Fries aren't supposed to be healthy. Give me the grease. Even adding sauce to them (I tried sriracha) did no good. I will never have fries there again.",,,,,,,,
KGQoAEq6O9PFOPBFUN0ykA,3,"I should probably be more generous with the stars here because I eat there often but there are just too many better burrito joints in the city.

This location is down the street from me so I go often due to my burrito addiction. I basically always get the lil (their smallest size) bean and cheese on whole wheat. Same order I get at Burrito Bandidos but this place just gets something wrong along the way.

Beans are tasty and smokey in flavour, they offer chow mein along with the rice but I usually skip it. Bit too much starch for my liking. Then they have the usual toppings that I indulge in - lettuce, pico de gallo, jalapeno, cilantro, peppers, salsa, sour cream, burrito sauce (it's very tasty here), but they also have coleslaw which I think is gross and the vinegar dressing takes over and runs throughout the burrito. They also will crunch up some chips in there which is kind of a nice touch. Watch out for the hot sauce, I ask for a little bit which can vary depending on the person making it but it is extremely spicy. My husband likes the burn so he goes for it.

They grill the burritos which I also appreciate but again it never comes out like Bandidos. 

Try the Blair's Death Rain chips if you want to ruin your night and your taste buds! 

In conclusion, it gives me my fix when I need one and that's about it.",,,,,,,,
6QvGvN24PfWvZw9roO--tQ,3,"The food here was decent, the prices standard. I tried the Korean stew with beef, the Bulgogi BBQ for two and the seafood pancake- all good but not a standout. The server was kind of awkward and made us feel like we were inconveniencing him when asking for drinks. My friends appetizer came out basically at the end of the meal. The beers were v cheap though.",,,,,,,,
xQIZI0hzTbZGvs4Vorff8Q,3,"The best thing about this place are the bathrooms! No Shit! Er, I mean no kidding!

The decor in the bathroom is expensive, mimicking a Japanese ancient Castle, with large cuts on stone masonry, copper pots for sinks, and metal tubes to look like large bamboo as the faucets. 

The next best thing is the large stone in the middle of the room. It is a large rock with a spotlight on it, and mimicks a Japanese rock garden.

The third best thing is the out door patio seating, with the misters going full blast as the tempurature still hovers around 100 at 11:00pm in August. There are several tables out there, and also some couches.

The 4th best thing is the Pachinko machines in the entryway, brightly lit and real, However, as the cute hostess will tell you, she has no balls (for the pachinko machines, stupid!)

The 5th best thing is their large drink menu of specialty drinks. I didn't look in there for an ""Orgasm"" or a ""SloeComfortableScrew Against the Wall"", or other ridiculous concoctions, etc. 

I felt like a Tanqueray and Tonic.  No, Make it two!

The rest of what they have to offer is, well, meh!",,,,,,,,
0HbnybCS8KGEJbfQ36LdqA,3,"It has a nice, pleasant atmosphere. I had pad woon sen and it was good. However, for the price, I feel that I could have a dish that was as good at other Thai places around C-U. Might visit again if I was looking to eat at a place further away from campus.",,,,,,,,
853q8QtkhG8j5fruuHRpsg,3,"Perfectly good vegetarian plates. But 3 stars because they won't even give you a glass of water! Seriously? I mean charge a quarter for a cup if you have to, but to force me to buy a bottle of water... Not cool, when Toronto has perfectly good tap water.",,,,,,,,
wcJbMcRvw2v3USIozELcOA,3,"This place is nothing special.  The food was good, but not great.  The service was fast and friendly, but again the food was nothing worth going back for.  I don't even remember what it is that I ate, so that in itself should tell you something about the place.  Or does that tell you something about me?  Yes, I am getting old, but I can remember when something is worth having again!",,,,,,,,
07z7AKpnIsjxquIcfmfRNA,3,"I will only add to the many reviews saying that the service here is pretty terrible, but the food is pretty good.  But I will add that I went to the Pita Jungle location in Scottsdale and received better service.  Still not great, but better.

Their falafel plate is great, the honey pasta salad is good but easily made at home, and their hummus is reliable but again, I could make this at home and not be ignored by indifferent servers as I wait 20 minutes for my check.",,,,,,,,
NTGXA6pq7KsRbK8uzS3F5g,3,"Came here to celebrate an event & apparently during the day you can order a drink at the bar but have to get up walk around to the front & order food & they don't give you water at the bar either. I understand if I was sitting at the table, but I'm right at the bar!! I couldn't even get bartender to say hello or tell me initially what their daytime policy was for food ordering. I had to walk around to the counter to ask for a napkin!! Martini was yummie is only reason this got 3 stars.",,,,,,,,
