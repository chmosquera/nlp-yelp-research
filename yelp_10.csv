Staff was very helpful and friendly.",0,0,0,4.0,84,Diners;Food;Restaurants;Delis,,,

We had their beef tartar and pork belly to start and a salmon dish and lamb meal for mains. Everything was incredible! I could go on at length about how all the listed ingredients really make their dishes amazing but honestly you just need to go. 

A bit outside of downtown montreal but take the metro out and it's less than a 10 minute walk from the station.",0,0,0,4.5,50,Restaurants;Canadian (New);Italian,,,

They are known for smoked meat which most deli's have but their brisket sandwich is what I come to montreal for. They've got about 12 seats outside to go along with the inside. 

The smoked meat is up there in quality and taste with Schwartz's and you'll find less tourists at Lester's as well.",0,0,0,4.0,70,Specialty Food;Food;Sandwiches;Restaurants;Burgers;Delis,,,

The food speaks for itself, so good. Burgers are made to order and the meat is put on the grill when you order your sandwich. Getting the small burger just means 1 patty, the regular is a 2 patty burger which is twice the deliciousness. 

Getting the Cajun fries adds a bit of spice to them and whatever size you order they always throw more fries (a lot more fries) into the bag.",0,0,0,3.5,61,Fast Food;Restaurants;Burgers,,,

Each bar was more fun than the last. Downtown Las Vegas has changed so much and for the better. We had a wide age range in this group from early 20's to mid 50's and everyone had so much fun! Our driver Tony was knowledgable , friendly and just plain fun! Would recommend this to anyone looking to do something different away from the strip.

Not quite the same as Chinatown in terms of pricing (slightly higher) but definitely one of the better Vietnamese restaurants outside of the neighbourhood. When I don't have time to go to Chinatown, this is the next best thing as it is down the street from me.

So far the only items I have tried are the phos (beef, chicken & vegetarian) - and they have not disappointed me! Especially the chicken pho.

Next time I go back, I'm going to try the banh cuon (steamed rice noodle) and the vermicelli!",0,0,2,4.0,111,Thai;Restaurants;Vietnamese,,,

Haven't done the poutine taste test yet with smoke's but Im excited to see which is better. However poutini's might win as they are vegan and gluten-free",1,0,0,3.5,251,Restaurants;Fast Food;Poutineries,,,

Peggy is great with dogs and does a great job! She is very patience with him and will make any adjustments you need before you leave the store. My little guy has no problems coming here.

They also have very good bully sticks (the non-smelly ones) that my little guy and his friends love!",3,0,0,5.0,3,Pet Groomers;Pet Services;Pets,,,
