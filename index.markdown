- Performing topic modeling and sentiment analysis on a set of reviews
- Given a single reivew, what topics are discussed? And what is the sentiment of each topic?
- Use topic modeling to create a model that extracts topics of a given review
- Split up a review into phrases or sentences such that each phrase is about a single attribute. Predict the topics for that phrase and its weighted topic scores. Calculate the sentiment. A single review will be about multiple topics, weighted, and the average sentiment of each topic is given. 

## Questions we can answer
- What is this review concerned about? How did the customer feel about what?
- I cannot tolerate rude servers. Which restaurants have great customer service?
